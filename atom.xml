    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since losing the old blog host I&#8217;ve been trying to reclaim what I could
from the Wayback Machine, particularly archives of Helen&#8217;s blog.</p>

<p>There aren&#8217;t enough entries saved to cover the whole year, even if we
ignore the entries which aren&#8217;t part of the challenge. Which basically
means we&#8217;ve lost the record of the challenge and frankly I&#8217;m gutted by
this state of affairs.</p>

<p>I have 67 saved entries and there should be about 190, though some of
those will be links to the same article. This is still a lot of missing
posts.</p>

<p>At this point I&#8217;m beginning to wonder if saving those 67 is worth it.
I&#8217;m quite demoralised.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the loss of my old blog, which I hope to at least salvage
from the Wayback Machine at some point, I&#8217;ve moved over to using
Octopress which has the built-in advantage of backed-up posts.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#8217;t be able to lose it all again.</p>

<p>(What is it about backing up data? You never do it until you&#8217;ve
been burned once? I think that seems about right. Everyone is
invincible until the first time they are laid low.)</p>

<p>Soon I will get my domain redirected here, so while things are
interrupted they will not be interrupted forever.</p>
