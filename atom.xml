    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.omnimovement.com/blog-2/" title="Fundamentals vs Basics: What’s the Difference and Why Does it Matter?">this article on fundamentals and basics</a> the author defines the two exactly for his own purposes and I think that has value so I’ll use those definitions here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental: Distance, Timing, Position</li>
<li>Basics: Simple moves that everything else is built on</li>
</ul>
<p>Moves we covered in Mestre Marrom’s recent workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Negativa</li>
<li>Role</li>
<li>Queda de quattro</li>
<li>Raba de arraia</li>
<li>Escalomente (?)</li>
<li>Cabecada</li>
<li>Rasteira</li>
<li>Mole (?)</li>
<li>Chapa</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these the basic steps would be the <em>queda de quatro</em>, the <em>role</em> and the <em>negativa</em>, all escapes in some way. There’s probably some others that we did not cover at the weekend but that make sense as basics. There’s nothing inverted on that list, for example.</p>
<p>Marrom was repeatedly emphasising the dynamic of attack and defend, enter and exit, which does link closely with the fundamental of Distance. Moving in and moving out again whenever there is a threat of an attack instead of getting into a ungraceful game of strike-counterstrike where nothing is effective and the game disintegrates.</p>
<p>Timing is primary controlled by the rhythm of the bateria. The pace matches that rhythm in some way, though not necessarily one to one. Off-beat attacks are defined by the existence of the rhythm of the bateria.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Operant conditioning in martial arts training</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article, <a href="http://ymaa.com/articles/2015/1/the-practical-problem-of-teaching-self-defense">The Practical Problem of Teaching Self Defense</a> by Rory Miller, was recently posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/4ajbis/rory_miller_article_on_practical_problems_when/">the /r/martialarts subreddit</a>.</p>
<p>Amongst the many interesting things it had to say was one key section that jumped right out at me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operant conditioning is using a stimulus-response-reward/punish pattern to bypass cognitive processing. In other words, if you want someone to do something fast, you have to condition it, not train it. It bypasses the cognitive processing and gets responses very close to reflex speed. It is also faster than training. It may have taken you a thousand reps before you can block a punch at speed, but it only took one rep to learn not to touch a hot stove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is the guiding principal behind the teaching at Cross Combat that I’ve been missing when trying to analyse it. And when trying to redirect the ideas towards ways of teaching capoeira. It immediately set my hair on fire, anyway!</p>
<p>This next section too seemed very relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to mess up operant conditioning. Correcting the student, micromanaging, can turn conditioning into training. And training, despite what you may have been told, rarely comes out under stress. Conditioning does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there’s one thing that can be levelled accurately at Cross Combat’s training style it’s that there’s very little in the way of hands-on correction and micromanaging. There are broad broad brushstrokes and lots of “games”.</p>
<p>I’ve been reading and re-reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning#Concepts_and_procedures">concepts and procedures</a> section of the Operant Conditioning wikipedia article. Thinking about training movements and how they fall into the reinforcement/punishment spectrum.</p>
<p>It seems the four basic points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>positive reinforcement — reward for doing something good</li>
<li>negative reinforcement — remove discomforts for doing something good</li>
<li>positive punishment — penalty for doing something bad</li>
<li>negative punishment — remove comfort for doing something bad</li>
</ul>
<p>but I doubt it’s possible to cover all four with one exercise. However as long as one exercise has essentially a “win” condition for each player and that the behaviours that lead to that condition are what is intended, the rest shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A partner that has been swept to the ground is the reward for the successful rasteira — and the timing and placement of the successful rasteira are reinforced by the feelings of achievement in sweeping the feet of the partner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All the while the partner’s ginga is reinforced where they manage to control their weight distribution and balance against the rasteiras. The failures are punished accordingly by the sweeps, since even an unsuccessful sweep has an unsettling effect as the balance momentarily disappears…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m going to have to think about this a lot more.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A week skiing in Les 3 Vallees, based in La Tania. My second skiing holiday, after about two years of absence. We visited <a href="https://www.snowfactor.com/" title="Indoor ski centre in Glasgow">Xcape</a> at Braehead for an afternoon’s refreshing the mind and the limbs. I slowly worked my way out of snowplough turns and got a bit more confidence to say “let’s go”.</p>
<p>The holiday was a last-minute decision. We piggy-backed on the airport transfer that Helen’s parents were using though we weren’t staying with them. We stayed in a catered chalet with two other parties: the hillwalking parents of the chalet cook; and a family of snowboarders with friends in tow. So between skiing, snowboarding and hillwalking there was a variety of activities under discussion at the end of the day. The younger members of the snowboarding party were keen on action cam recordings so there was a lot of reviewing the day’s spills every evening.</p>
<p>On my first day I felt pretty nervous about the Blue runs and was keen to have someone to give me the tools and confidence to navigate them. The next day I got a private lesson from Alessandro at <a href="http://www.magicfr.com/ski-school-la-tania-2/">Magic in Motion Ski School</a>. Two short hours made all the difference and I came away feeling that, instead of being given the ability to ski better, I was given the ability to feel safe in troubling conditions. Situations that were previously tricky were still tricky, but I only had to recall the simple instructions I was given and it would magically work out anyway. It was like a shortcut to skiing!</p>
<p>He watched me ski some simple turns and told me what my overall problem was, mechanically, and how that relates to my fears. He told me how skiing should be done, in terms of balance distribution (the legs do the skiing, the body does the compensation) and the physics of it all. But this was just background: the important part was he gave me simple actions to try in order to fix my problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ride with my shoulders square to the downhill, always looking down. If you start facing in the direction of the skis across the hill you “spin” uphill and fall. Which is what I was experiencing.</li>
<li>Compensate for the angle of the legs on each turn by moving the body “outside”. If you lean “inside” the turn you can only maintain balance if you continue the turn in a full circle, back uphill. So again, leaning inside makes you fall uphill.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of the week I went out often with Helen and her parents and their party, slowly getting better using the simple ideas that Alessandro gave me. Every day there were trials. Getting hot and tired makes it harder. The snow changes over the course of the day. Hunger and fatigue lead to anger and frustration. But I also started to enjoy the runs too. Sometimes going fast was fun! One piste in particular, called Biche, we did many times a day. I should have had an action cam for that!</p>
<p>It’s not all fast skis and loose bindings, of course. Mountain diots, pot au feu, genepi, creme de violette — all there for the taking. And a day of skiing really gives you an appetite. The evenings in the chalet were nice and the others staying there were all friendly and chatty, with interesting experiences. I think we all got on really well.</p>
<p>In one short week my skiing came on a huge leap and I had a great time. I’m now eager to go skiing again, the addiction is forming!</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Reflections on teaching a capoeira class</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did it, I taught a class from beginning to (almost<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) end. And it went pretty well in my humble opinion.</p>
<h3 id="beginning">Beginning</h3>
<p>I was a bit nervous at first. People started filing in and since Sandy was there everyone probably assumed that he was taking the class. But I just loudly shouted “warm up time!” and “follow me!” and everyone just fell into line. It was a bit quiet so I tried to get some high-fives going as we jogged in columns up and down the hall. Just <em>anything</em> to get people into an active and giving mood.</p>
<p>I need to plan this bit better still and maybe work on some mental warmup exercises to bring people into the right mindset for the lesson.</p>
<p>After some athletic stuff to get the blood flowing I did some stretching in a circle and got the two moves we’d be working on (<em>au</em> and <em>cabeçada</em>) into the stretching routine. This was a spur-of-the-moment thing but it worked well: I would definitely recreate this in future, bringing in whatever moves were relevant to the lesson plan.</p>
<h3 id="middle">Middle</h3>
<p>I used Kojak as a first demo partner but I didn’t do it very well. I expected him to get into the right position, the one that I wanted. What I should have just done is demonstrate the position and what I wanted him to concentrate on. This would have been clearer for everyone, less confusing for him and easier for me. I need to get out of the habit of explaining: talking gets in the way of showing which gets in the way of doing. (I was also rude to Kojak because he didn’t do what I expected of him, which wasn’t good at all. I made the mistake of getting feedback from him about what he did wrong. But of course he didn’t know what I wanted so he couldn’t say how what he did was different. I could have bypassed that unpleasantness of putting him on the spot if I’d just done everything physically and let him copy.)</p>
<p>At another point I tried explaining what I wanted in words without running through it. This was confusing but at least I was asked for a demonstration also (I should not have needed asking). When I got a chance to try the move properly in training I realised a more natural way of demonstrating it, as one would in a real game. If I had tried more demonstration and less explanation this might have come sooner — soon enough that I could integrate it into the exercise.</p>
<p>The class focused on <em>au</em> which is quickly tiring. People were definitely flagging by the end. I don’t know if that was partly because they were initially going too hard or out of shape. I also felt that I could go longer because I was demonstrating and leading rather than trying to follow along. Whatever the case it might be worth pulling back on the amount of stuff I try to cover in one session if it’s as strenuous as this. Some mid-point breather seems sensible but I don’t want to lose the pace of the class entirely.</p>
<p>Trying to get people to follow instructions given is very difficult, there is no way around that. The temptation to ginga, add resistance or otherwise make it difficult for training partners to train seems overwhelming. People want to do things you didn’t ask them to do and that can negate the learning value of the exercise. Malicia may be great in a roda but it’s terrible in training.</p>
<p>There was one exercise which didn’t work well — I had not trained it and would have liked a chance to workshop it a bit before asking others to do it. Going in with something uncertain like that can pull the energy out of the class. If the idea is <em>not</em> to discuss and work through ideas then the momentum takes a nosedive when people start fiddling. This is nobody’s fault but the instructor: an experimentation session is a different beast and letting the class turn into one is a teaching problem.</p>
<h3 id="end">End</h3>
<p>At the end of the session things kind of petered out a little which was disappointing. I made two mistakes here. I wasn’t clear about how the class was to end — I started giving people latitude about what to do when I knew what I wanted them to do. But I guess I was trying to show some sympathy for people being tired. The problem was that I had about 25 minutes left and everyone was close to mutiny from being asked to do too much. I had nothing to fill the last 15–20 minutes that would wind things down but still provide value and focus on the teaching.</p>
<p>This reiterates the point from earlier: if it’s an intense class — which it should be — there needs to be some built-in reset activities or down time that I can use when everyone is too fatigued to learn. This may take the form of an “interval” or it may just be an extended “warm down” with several activities which get increasingly less energetic or difficult. The trick of course is finding something that (a) isn’t too much a change of direction technically and (b) keeps the momentum/enthusiasm going if there is still plenty of time on the clock.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a warm-down or stretching routine in mind but everybody mostly managed to pull one together collectively. Again the lack of definite “now we’re doing this” and “now we’re doing that” meant it wasn’t clear what was happening. It was more organic and so ambiguous even when we were obviously all standing or sitting in a circle to stretch. Having a clear end point is valuable.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Social interaction is important to get people working together.</li>
<li>Always show instead of tell. A small number of simple verbal instructions can be used as reminders.</li>
<li>A definite beginning and a definite ending are good.</li>
<li>Emphasise the importance of working together.</li>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A last-minute booking of a single-centre Headwater ‘activity’ holiday, in this case cycling in north-east Italy. Table for two please.</p>
<h3 id="antipasto">Antipasto</h3>
<p>Early morning travel to Edinburgh airport, in that middle zone between the night buses finishing and the trams starting. The N22 goes straight from front door to check-in desk but only works if you’re flying at stupid-o’clock.</p>
<p>Arrived at Venice Marco Polo and got the bus to Venice Mestre train station for the ride to Vicenza. We hid in the shade and I worried about the possibility of sunburn from reflected light. The scrolling temperature indicator on the street corner said 37 degrees C. At what temperature do people melt?</p>
<p>Picked up by the rep at Vicenza station. Waited for another couple who had got the wrong train then drove us all to the agriturismo L’Albara. On arrival we were introduced to the route maps for the area and our bikes. I had taken my own saddle which I fitted but didn’t spend enough time adjusting the rest of the bike. This was my downfall because the tools were taken away by the rep after this. It wasn’t until we had done a full day’s riding that we knew where the problems lay.</p>
<h3 id="primo">Primo</h3>
<p>The weather was scorching and we were never great at getting out onto the road early. Most days it was 11am before we started cycling — by which point the coolness has gone out of the day.</p>
<p>The landscape was flat and the routes were along quiet country roads or segregated cycle paths. Drivers were fantastic about giving space or holding back where appropriate.</p>
<p>We followed routes to a lake, to churches and to villas. There wasn’t a great deal of “visiting” though. We mostly sat in cafes and bars away from the heat, eating and drinking. To tell you the truth most of the holiday was secretly devoted to finding proper Italian ice cream.</p>
<h3 id="secondo">Secondo</h3>
<p>We returned most days between 4 and 5pm to sit round the pool reading and taking the occasional dip. At first there was no hot water for the shower which was frustrating though manageable because the weather was so hot. Doing a few lengths of the unheated pool was still very comfortable after six o’clock at night.</p>
<p>Dinner was at eight on communal tables with the other guests, two older couples from Manchester and Wrexham. Nearly everything we ate and drank was produced on site: the wine and grappa, the vegetables, the quails. There were cherries everywhere and many cherry-based things for dessert: ice cream, pie, jelly…</p>
<h3 id="dolce">Dolce</h3>
<p>We left Italy in the same heat as we arrived in. The last two days promised a storm but not much became of it. We had some rain but the sun returned and the wet roads started to steam. We rode home through pockets of hot sticky air.</p>
<p>There were no missed trains and no missed flights. It was raining when we arrived in Edinburgh.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/universityofedinburgh/17797386523" title="Art and anatomy event illustrates the wonders of the human body by The University of Edinburgh, on Flickr"><img src="https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7737/17797386523_e1b8559b3f.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Art and anatomy event illustrates the wonders of the human body"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/artandanatomyedinburgh" title="Art and Anatomy Facebook page">Art and Anatomy</a> is a group which aims to teach anatomy to medical students at Edinburgh university through artistic methods: body painting and sculpture being the two obvious approaches. As a promotional thing they ran an evening session for the public, letting people have a go at sculpting clay hearts and painting the structures of the hand onto each other.</p>
<p>At the same time American artist <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Danny-Quirk-Artwork/283073600976" title="Danny Quirk&#39;s Facebook page">Danny Quirk</a> was nearby (well, London) for a seminar so agreed to come to Edinburgh and demonstrate his own body painting techniques. He has done a lot of anatomical painting on bodies. His images use acrylic paint and marker pen rather than “face paint” which is water based, so his body paintings are so much more vivid and powerful.</p>
<p>Helen had agreed to help out with some of the anatomical teaching side of the day and as soon as I saw photos of Danny Quirk’s work I knew I wanted to volunteer. As luck would have it the model that had been arranged (another medic) had a latex allergy — and the acrylic/marker pen is painted onto a transparent latex layer which is directly on the skin. Clearly she was not the best candidate so I stepped up to the mark.</p>
<p>We started early — I stripped off my shirt and painting began before 8 AM. We took a brief few minutes out for lunch and a few toilet breaks but basically the work continued until about four o’clock in the afternoon. Walking through the halls of the medical school building topless to visit the toilet was quite amusing. I’m unsure how many people who saw me knew what was happening; it wasn’t obvious I was painted until I was walking away.</p>
<p>The evening lecture was the point at which Danny unveiled his new work (ie me). Then the audience went off to their chosen workshops and to look round the medical artifacts museum and the “artist’s studio” where medical illustrators in the past would work from the results from the dissection table.</p>
<p>The day received a lot of press and there were photographers in from the university and a bunch of high profile papers/press agencies. My photo appeared in the Metro and the BMJ while others got into the Herald etc. You can see the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/universityofedinburgh/sets/72157653536069500" title="Edinburgh University photos from Art &amp; Anatomy event">university press’s official photographs here</a>.</p>
<p>The latex sheet was removed in one piece the following day and you can see the video of the process. The whole thing took nearly an hour but it’s been edited so you don’t lose all interest. I don’t have a hairy back but removing a full sheet of latex wasn’t a pleasant experience. The tiny hairs near the spine seemed to be a consistent source of pain. I would recommend anyone who did this in future to just shave regardless of how unhairy you are.</p>
<iframe class="show" width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvsgNR7aR9I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>We’ve still got the piece at the moment, weighted down on a piece of mounting board under plastic sheet and heavy (anatomy) textbooks. The plan is to get some kind of boxes to display it like items in a specimen case. Meanwhile Danny’s promised to send a cleaned up photograph of me and my back to keep on the wall.</p>
<p>Totally great, really glad I signed up for the day.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It all went according to plan. I took the train from Edinburgh to Glasgow Queen Street station, talking to a guy who was cycling up the west coast for a week. We discussed riding on the continent, the value of step-through frames when you get old enough that stepping over the saddle is difficult, and the easy nature of Rohloff internal hub gears.</p>
<p>From Queen Street I rode round the corner to Central Station and boarded the train to Ayr. I spoke to a woman wearing civvies but riding a skinny road bike. She had cleated cycling shoes to provide the interface: more roadie than casual on the feet. She soon realised she was on the wrong train and got off at the next station to return on the next available train.</p>
<p>I arrived at Ayr and found a Greggs to sell me two sausage rolls and a fudge donut for lunch. They were sold out of fudge donuts so I had to make do with chocolate, which I call “slumming it”. I set off straight away following the Bike Hub app which is absolutely terrible. The on-screen map isn’t very detailed. Your location on the map is marked with a small circle which means your own direction isn’t obvious. The map also doesn’t re-orient as you turn, so it quickly becomes useless at junctions — peering at the tiny writing for road names and hunting around for the related street signs makes for very frustrating progress. I switched to Google Maps before I left Ayr.</p>
<p>The A713 is a straightforward but unpleasant road from Ayr to Carlisle through the town of Dalmellington. The festival is a few miles beyond Dalmellington so I was mostly following the road signs. I stopped in a layby while the traffic got busy to eat my sausage rolls. I passed a few lone cyclists and a couple on a touring tandem. I was tempted by the Hollybush Inn at the top of a hill but it was still early in the day. I kept going.</p>
<p>I stopped later near the Scottish steam engine centre (or something) for my chocolate donut. The chocolate was quite runny but not bad. I didn’t visit the steam trains. I had set off behind schedule and wasted a lot of time trying to get out of Ayr so I had little time to waste on sightseeing.</p>
<p>I went up some narrow, winding roads between Dalmellington and the turn-off to the festival site. Most of the traffic at this point was quite good with the occasional scary idiot. Seeing police cordon tape and bits of wrecked cars (including the whole front bumper and registration number of a blue car) that had been flung ten metres off the road in some high-speed collision was quite sobering and more than a little alarming. It’s easy to feel very vulnerable in such a situation — because truly you are vulnerable.</p>
<p>I reach the turn-off for Knockengorroch which was about half a mile of uphill followed by three miles of downhill. Exhilerating when you’ve been slogging for so long! I think I arrived at the area of grass that would be my pitch at about 5.30. It was getting colder so I’m glad I didn’t waste any time.</p>
<hr />
<p>The festival went reasonably well though I suffered from poor wardrobe choice a lot of the time. Warmer clothes, including a better jacket, would have really cheered me up. On my last night I ended up wearing most of my cycling gear underneath my day clothes because it was so chilly.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the return journey I left just before noon, forcing my way up the long downhill to the festival site and back onto the main road. My initial impression that the route had been quite uphill on the way seemed accurate: it was a lot more downhill on the return journey with some spots that were considerably faster to travel than my average. I think about 8mph had been my pace on the way out. I stopped for my lunch at the aforementioned Hollybush Inn on the way back but I would have made much better time otherwise.</p>
<p>In future I would try to travel by more obscure routes if possible, leaving more time where necessary. I would have better paper maps and a better plan to escape the big cities (well, escape Ayr). Ending up on dual carriageways and motorways is all too easy: nobody bothers signposting the slow roads with big signs!</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a few short days I’m going to make my way to <a href="http://www.knockengorroch.org.uk" title="Knockengorroch festival, 21-24 May">Knockengorroch World Ceilidh 2015</a> by bike. I’ve taken Thursday, Friday and Monday off work to reduce the anxiety of the journey but I’ve still managed to convince myself that I’m not up to the challenge and reduced my journey further.</p>
<p>I had originally wanted to cycle there in two stages and to camp somewhere in between on the Thursday night. But now I’ve just decided to take the train to Ayr and travel the remainder of the distance by bike in one day — which is only 22 miles. This is the distance between work and home which I’ve done several times now and though I will be doing it laden with camping gear I will also have many hours to spare. Google Maps reckons I can do it in two and a half hours. Maybe it’ll be 3 hours in the end as Google doesn’t really know about hills or luggage.</p>
<p>I’ve had a trial run with panniers and tent loaded on the bike. I went for a sedate few miles on the NEPN in the Leith end of town. Tonight I will try to pack everything properly to work out what I need and where it should go.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since starting BJJ it’s been harder to remain disconnected from people when playing capoeira. Either I can fight this or embrace it and see where it leads. So what does it mean to be all “touchy touchy” in capoeira? Can I make something positive out of this?</p>
<p>Against a <em>meia lua</em> or <em>rabo de arraia</em> it makes sense to have contact with the kicking leg while moving out of the way. In particular slower kicks which can be easily reversed to kick from different directions. Ducking under a meia lua puts the face quite close to the kicking leg and it’s not uncommon for the person to shift their weight and come back with the foot right towards your face.</p>
<p>The traditional defence is a somewhat ambiguous “arms held out in midair” behaviour which means the hands are at the right height to prevent incoming strikes but are not very strong.</p>
<p>I wonder whether a better approach is a pre-emptive touch or “frame” to maintain the right distance and a sense of safety. Depending on the game it could be a back-of-the-hand, a bladed hand, a forearm or upper arm. The key difference between this and the normal defence is that the “acceleration” time of a strike is zero. The strength of the kick comes from the momentum when it strikes — if there is no distance before impact then the kick becomes a push and <em>meia lua</em> and <em>rabo de arraia</em> are not push kicks and have no strength like that.</p>
<p>Another detail of course is a tactical one. If you’ve got a hand on a person’s limb then you don’t need to watch it to know where it is and what direction it’s moving. You can spare your eyes for other places.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>Lower gear on Fuji for Edinburgh's hills</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stock Fuji Track Classic comes with a 46/16 gear ratio, which works out at <a href="http://www.bikecalc.com/gear_inches">about 76 gear inches</a>. This is pretty good on a flat road. Riding across the work car park or along George Street is very relaxing. What it’s not great for is Edinburgh’s sharp inclines, particularly without a head start. Getting the initial forward movement on the hill in such a high gear is pretty harsh!</p>
<p>The solution then was to adjust the gear to something a bit lower. Replacing the 16 tooth cog with an 18T produces 67 inches which is a substantial step down. There’s always a trade off in these things and there were two here. The first of course is that a gear which is good for climbing is not good for descending. I must learn to spin faster (though this is always true). The second consideration is chain length since altering the cog size shifts everything around. The move to 18T is the most I can manage with this chain; anything larger would require an extra link in the chain to compensate.</p>
<p>Finally in the process of putting it all together I learned the difference between a fixed hub and a freewheel hub since my bike has one of each. On the fixed side there’s a slightly larger diameter forward-thread to accept the cog and then a smaller diameter section which is reverse threaded. The cog screws in “forward” and the lockring screws in “backward” to prevent the cog coming undone with a hard backpressure.</p>
<p>The other side has only a forward-threaded section: there is no room for a lockring. Opinions differ as to whether this is a bad thing or not. If the cog is wound tightly enough then it shouldn’t be, and each pedal stroke under normal use will tighten the cog further. Personally I would prefer the safety of a lockring and I would have put my new 18T cog on the side which fits the lockring… except I couldn’t get the old 16T off first! It’s had a lot of hard pushing and is quite firmly locked in place.</p>]]></summary>
