    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been doing capoeira now for about two years I think, and
one thing that hasn't really changed in that time is my complete
inability to do a handstand or a cartwheel.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the year (you know, midway through January)
I've had an alarm on my phone that buzzes at 6.30pm <em>every single day</em>
and tells me I have to practise. Nearly every single day since I started I
have set aside five minutes to practise. I set a timer so that I don't
do 3 minutes then decide that I'm probably done, and so that I stop at
5 minutes. The point is that it's not supposed to be a burden or a
long gruelling exercise regime.</p>

<p>Five minutes practice every day --- throwing myself up against a bare
wall initially, but slowly becoming more independent --- has brought
about a massive change. I'm still not capable of busting out amazing
inverted moves but if I'd known two years ago that I could be where I
am now with only month of this I would be shocked.</p>

<p>I'll continue to be shocked and I hope the improvements will continue
too.</p>
