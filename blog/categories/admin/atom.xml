    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have just discovered, while adding an <a href="/about">about page</a> to this blog, that the standard Markdown processor used by Octopress (called RDiscount) doesn't conform to the Markdown standard. I mean in particular the reference-style links, which I happen to be quite fond of. You should be able to include <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters around URLs like so:</p>

<p><code>
</code></p>

<p>Instead of stripping out these optional characters RDiscount passes them on and they get translated into HTML entities (<code>&amp;lt;</code>) which causes further steps in the chain to choke. Ultimately you end up with a very broken web page.</p>

<p>A simple <code>An [example link] [eg].</code> turns into the following mess --- oh dear.</p>

<p>``` html</p>

<p>An <a href="&lt;http://www.example.com>&#8221; title=&#8221;The canonical example page&#8221;>example link</a>.</p>


<p>```</p>

<p>Notice how the opening quote never gets closed? The rest of that paragraph is the <code>href</code> for that link! So I will have to learn to omit the angle brackets:</p>

<p><code>
</code></p>

<p>PS. While writing <em>this</em> post I discovered that Pygments.rb (which does syntax highlighting for Octopress) doesn't support Markdown as a highlightable language (fair enough, can't cover everything) --- but also that it crashes if you name a language it doesn't know. Not having a good day.</p>

<p><code>
</code> markdown I will kill your highlighter

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After the loss of my old blog, which I hope to at least salvage
from the Wayback Machine at some point, I've moved over to using
Octopress which has the built-in advantage of backed-up posts.</p>

<p>I shouldn't be able to lose it all again.</p>

<p>(What is it about backing up data? You never do it until you've
been burned once? I think that seems about right. Everyone is
invincible until the first time they are laid low.)</p>

<p>Soon I will get my domain redirected here, so while things are
interrupted they will not be interrupted forever.</p>
