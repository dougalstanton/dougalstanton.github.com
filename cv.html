<h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>
<section>
<p>I am a software engineer working in the embedded systems industry, developing applications in C and C++ for proprietary systems. I have experience working with legacy codebases and the constraints of low-powered systems. My emphasis at work is on using robust design and automated testing to minimise opportunity for mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>C and C++ professionally, with hobby experience in Haskell.</li>
<li>Eclipse, Vim and GDB development tools.</li>
<li>Subversion, Git (including Git-SVN), ClearCase source control.</li>
<li>Windows, Linux and Solaris.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software-engineer-honeywell-security-march-2011-november-2013">Software Engineer, Honeywell Security, March 2011 – November 2013</h3>
<p>Developing alarm panel control software for the Galaxy range of alarm panels. Development with the <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/" title="eCos embedded RTOS">eCos RTOS</a>, <a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/arm/default.aspx" title="Atmel ARM7TMDI processor">Atmel ARM7 processor</a> and <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSAM-ICE.aspx" title="Atmel SAM-ICE JTAG adapter for ARM7">SAM-ICE JTAG adapter</a> and custom control hardware.</p>
<h4 id="key-responsibilities">Key responsibilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Development of features for real-time control systems and communication hardware transmitting over PSTN, USB, GSM/GPRS and Ethernet to remote sites using proprietary and industry standard protocols.</li>
<li>Maintaining compliance with international standards for security products.</li>
<li>Triage and correction of issues identified by Product Quality Department and customer use.</li>
<li>Integration testing and documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="key-achievements">Key achievements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Installation of a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" title="Jenkins Continuous Integration">continuous integration server</a> to automate building and static analysis. During phases of intense development these tests caught a number of failures. This venture became an officially supported project due to its success.</li>
<li>Development of a static analysis tool to validate some important data stored in a custom format. This tool identified flaws which would have been hidden for months, and continues to guard against further problems as part of static testing.</li>
<li>Development of an integrated test framework to automate integration tests on the target systems. Addition of these tests also helped identify flaws in existing sytems and guard against regressions.</li>
<li>Co-authoring a patent which was filed in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="development-engineer-cisco-system-via-aap3-ltd-20072010">Development Engineer, Cisco System (via AAP3 Ltd), 2007–2010</h3>
