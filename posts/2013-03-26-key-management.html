<h2>Key management (in the real world)</h2>
<section>
<p>There isn’t really a solution to having too many keys. You just have to make one mistake with that jailer’s bunch that you haul around everywhere — and suddenly you can’t get into your house, you can’t open up at work, you can’t unlock your bike, and so on until you begin to wonder: why haven’t we solved this yet?</p>
<p>Thankfully this hasn’t happened to me, but it has happened very recently to someone that I know. And I’m conscious that I do have a fairly large bunch of keys with me at all times, which is a liability.</p>
<p>There’s not even a comfortable way to carry them in my pocket without jabbing myself in the leg. I’d love to leave most of them at home; maybe have some kind of thumb-print access for the flat or something. Or voice recognition, that would be good (until it doesn’t work).</p>
