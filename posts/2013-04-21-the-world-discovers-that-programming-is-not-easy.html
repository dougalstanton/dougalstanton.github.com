<h2>The world discovers that programming is not easy</h2>
<section>
<p>It has recently been shown that <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/apr/18/uncovered-error-george-osborne-austerity" title="Erroneous Excel spreadsheet source for austerity measures">a 2010 economics paper built around an Excel spreadsheet contained an important error</a>, and this error came from the code in the spreadsheet itself. To be exact, some conclusions of the paper hinged on a spreadsheet bug.</p>
<p>So it becomes clear to the world at large that Excel spreadsheets are programming, and being programming they will almost definitely contain bugs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.</p>
<p>— Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a particular interest here because I believe that programming should be something more widely taught and understood. Part of this greater understanding and familiarity will of course hammer home a truth understood by programmers all over the world: it’s very easy to make a mistake which doesn’t show up until too late.</p>
