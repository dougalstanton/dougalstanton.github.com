<h2>Migration to Octopress etc</h2>
<section>
<p>After the loss of my old blog, which I hope to at least salvage from the Wayback Machine at some point, I’ve moved over to using Octopress which has the built-in advantage of backed-up posts.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t be able to lose it all again.</p>
<p>(What is it about backing up data? You never do it until you’ve been burned once? I think that seems about right. Everyone is invincible until the first time they are laid low.)</p>
<p>Soon I will get my domain redirected here, so while things are interrupted they will not be interrupted forever.</p>
