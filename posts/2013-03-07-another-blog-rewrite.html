<h2>Another blog rewrite, because the first one was so much fun</h2>
<section>
<p>Less than a month ago I set up this blog with <a href="http://octopress.org" title="Octopress, static blogging tool written in Ruby">Octopress</a>. I was inspired by <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2012/03/17/new-ish-year-new-ish-blog/" title="Dr Nick's blog, also using Octopress">Nick’s move in that direction</a>.</p>
<p>I suffered a great deal trying to get Ruby installed with the correct versions but in the end I managed it. I was impressed with how nice blogging could be when stripped down to the basics. I’ve been writing my posts with Markdown formatting for years — it’s nice that the rest of the blogging world has caught up. :-)</p>
<p>I was looking forward to blogging more, but the next time I tried to update my blog something had gone very wrong. The versions of various parts of the system had got out of sync and I couldn’t update any more.</p>
<p>At this point plan B kicked into play and I started looking at another tool for generating static blogs, <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/" title="Hakyll, static blogging tool/library written in Haskell">Hakyll</a>. It had one thing going strongly in its favour — it was written in Haskell which I understand rather than Ruby which I haven’t taken the time to study. But this familiarity was necessary because Hakyll is not a plug-n-play system. It’s more of a library suite for putting together your own static blog generator. (See Xmonad for the same story with tiling window managers.)</p>
<p>So I’ve been quiet on the blogging front in order to get this blog running in the background. I also had to come up with some style (sorry about that), which I have borrowed from various places. But as someone once said, “as long as you don’t leave any fingerprints at the scene of the crime”…</p>
