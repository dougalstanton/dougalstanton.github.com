<h2>Teaching styles in capoeira and BJJ</h2>
<section>
<p>It’s been about two months now since I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so I’ve got a better understanding of how it’s being taught now.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed with the teaching at Cross Combat, and I can tell it’s something that William and his team take a fair amount of pride in. It seems to rely on a few fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on one thing per class</li>
<li>Building technique piecemeal</li>
<li>Progressive resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing that seems outlandish, unusual or revolutionary but the reality is that it’s <em>productive</em>. On top of this there is some philosophical approach which emphasises exploration and flow over exacting instruction.</p>
<p>The attitude is very similar to the teaching in capoeira (at least, in Mão No Chão) but the actual teaching is very different structure is very different. We definitely <em>don’t</em> focus on a single thing during a lesson — a scattergun approach would be a more accurate description.</p>
<p>I think we try for progressive resistance but miss the full value. We can start off very collaborative but there’s no steady progression from there. A predictable next step for each level of resistance would be valuable to have: in this way it’s always obvious how the other person will react. On that topic a prohibition against <em>malicia</em> and <em>malandragem</em> during training until it’s explicitly allowed. Indeed, that is a level of resistance that can be saved for an actual game.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the Christmas holidays and several weeks since I’ve done any capoeira or been to a class. I’m going to rethink everything I have written here in light of what we actually do the next time I train.</p>
