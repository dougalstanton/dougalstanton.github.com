<h2>Life as a game, measured in blog posts and coffee spoons</h2>
<section>
<p>I’ve tried in the past to get into tools like <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com" title="Fitocracy, levelling-up your fitness?">Fitocracy</a>, whose gimmick is to make exercise a game in which you increase your high score by recording the physical workouts you do. I failed to get much satisfaction out of it for a couple of key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My cycling doesn’t really change, so while I do about 9 miles a day it never goes above that. The total miles covered keeps going up, which does afford more points, but I feel a bit of a fraud all along. I’m not getting faster and I’m not increasing my distance either.</li>
<li>Capoeira is a dynamic skill-based activity which does not lend itself to measurement with simple numbers like distance, time, mass or speed. To use an analogy, if I could run around really fast and hit tennis balls really hard neither of these would demonstrate I was progressing at tennis. Similarly someone with a less impressive serve and a slower dash could still trounce me if they had actual tennis experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have a Fitocracy account but I don’t do things which measure easily so I never use it.</p>
<p>Nick recently posted on this, <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2013/09/14/am-i-winning/" title="Some thoughts on Gamification">expanding the notion from simple fitness</a> to diverse aspects of life.</p>
