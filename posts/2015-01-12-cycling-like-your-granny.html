<h2>Cycling like your granny</h2>
<section>
<p>At the weekend I ventured out into some pretty foul weather for a trip to Hermiston Gait<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. According to Google Maps I could follow the NEPN for a chunk and get there in forty minutes. I set off at a relaxed pace and got lost. (I see now that I followed my nose and headed west along the Water of Leith at one point when I should have headed east and curved back on the cycle path.) But I had a successful shopping trip and was largely stress free while doing it.</p>
<p>It was my first visit to Hermiston Gait and Edinburgh Park station. In the summer I can definitely see myself hopping off the train there for a gentle ride back into town. The new shared path that runs alongside the tram is really relaxing compared to the stress of road travel. Cycling as it should be.</p>
<p>On my return journey I came a more direct route — past Haymarket, along Shandwick Place and into George Street before home. It was still raining and I was passed several times by cyclists in a hurry. I was trying my best to remain at a sedate pace; all the off-road travel I was doing certainly helped.</p>
<p>There’s a phrase on the City Cycling Edinburgh forums about <a href="http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/topic.php?id=5723" title="National 'ride like your gran' day">“cycling like your granny”</a>. This amounts to <em>not</em> battling with traffic and seeing how you travel. Limiting yourself to 10mph or coasting otherwise. The weekend’s trip on quiet segregated routes helped bring me closer to the relaxed mood I would have to be in to ride like that all the time.</p>
