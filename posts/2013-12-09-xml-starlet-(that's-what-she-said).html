<h2>XML Starlet (that's what she sed)</h2>
<section>
<p>The stream editor <code>sed</code> is a great tool for automating text editing — replacing names, date or other statements in a high-speed, programmable fashion.</p>
<p>One thing it isn’t really cut out for is XML because the structure of XML is not line-oriented. If you want to automate XML editing quickly I totally recommend <a href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net" title="XML Starlet Command Line XML Toolkit">XML Starlet</a> for the job. You can replace node names, attributes, values and so on nested deep inside an XML document while paying full heed to namespaces and such.</p>
<p>On top of that it also lets you see a simple overview and to select values out of documents. Once you get the hang of it you can do some really nice things. I recently got it to rewrite some version numbers inside an Eclipse <code>.cproject</code> file and the resulting script is about as readable and concise as you could hope for.</p>
<p>Looking at the examples I have barely touched the surface of what can be done with this tool but I’m already pretty impressed with what can be achieved.</p>
