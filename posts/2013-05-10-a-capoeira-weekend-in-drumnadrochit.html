<h2>A capoeira weekend in Drumnadrochit</h2>
<section>
<p>I’m just getting ready for weekend up north with the <a href="http://maonochao.org/2013/05/06/evening-classes-and-workshop-with-cm-dion/" title="Workshop with Dion near Inverness">Mão no Chão people and Dion</a>. I’ve got some bread getting ready, the hallway is piled high with an unsorted collection of things I could take including a tent and sleeping bags. I’m trying to work out if it’s possible to book train tickets home that are not eye-wateringly expensive. (The answer would appear to be “no”.)</p>
<p>The weather in Drumnadrochit says “rain” so a tent will probably not be so fun. I suspect thick socks and shoes might actually be more prudent, though we don’t plan on going for long walks.</p>
<p>I also have to think about getting something for lunch! Right, better get back to that bread, it’ll need worked a bit more and there’s no time to lose.</p>
