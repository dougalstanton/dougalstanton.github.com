<section>
<p>One of my absolute favourite authors, Iain (M) Banks, has announced he has late-stage cancer and is not expected to live out the year.</p>
<p>While he is making the most of his final months with family and friends the rest of the literary world is mourning him. This will no doubt come as a slight shock to him, but it isn’t surprising to me. He wrote some <em>exceedingly good books</em>.</p>
