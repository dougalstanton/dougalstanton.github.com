<h2>Not the worst Christmas ever!</h2>
<section>
<p>I spend Christmas day alone in the flat, cooking. For the first time I prepared a full meal for both sets of parents — our usual Christmas routine was abandoned because Helen was working until 6pm and started again on Boxing Day. Spending days away from the house was not an option.</p>
<p>I opted to cook venison instead of turkey. One, because it would mean I wasn’t playing to a rule-book and could remove items that I’m not keen on (sprouts, parsnips) without alarming anyone. Licence to play by my own rules! Also I’m not sure how well a turkey to feed seven would fit in our oven and still leave room for cooking roast potatoes, sausages and anything else required.</p>
<p>This is the first time we’ve had both sets of parents together for a sit down meal, for some reason. It went pretty well and the food was well-received. If anything we over-catered (there’s still a lot of red cabbage left over and even the small amount of broccoli wasn’t finished).</p>
<p>Due to time constraints we didn’t finish the present-opening. Helen and I still have things to give each other but I think (hope) everything that was due for other people went away with them.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I have more cold roast potatoes to eat.</p>
