<h2>Pain in all the diodes down my left side</h2>
<section>
<p>For a few weeks now I’ve been suffering from a terrible pain in my left side, tracing from about the middle of my left pec right round under the armpit. I remember first feeling it after the most recent charity roda in Edinburgh. I assumed it was an injury sustained <em>in</em> the roda but I couldn’t remember how exactly.</p>
<p>I left things a week, going so far as to stop doing handstands every night in order to give my side a rest. This proved incredibly difficult, and the next time I cracked and started doing handstands again the pain came back. The next morning I was in agony.</p>
<p>At the weekend in Drumnadrochit (which I’ll write about in another post) I tried to arm a berimbau and the pains in my side came back as hard as ever. At that point I realised that the real cause of my pain must have been trying to arm a particularly stiff viola (high-pitched berimbau), with what was clearly poor technique.</p>
<p>I need to practise stringing them using more body weight and less strength because that way, I hope, there will be fewer musical instrument-based injuries in future.</p>
