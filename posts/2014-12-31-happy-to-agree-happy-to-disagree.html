<h2>Happy to agree, happy to disagree</h2>
<section>
<p>I’ve been watching a lot of clips recently from the Mark Kermode/Simon Mayo review slot on Radio 5 Live. The radio reviews are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kermodeandmayo/" title="Kermode &amp; Mayo's Film Reviews">filmed and broadcast on their Youtube channel</a> so you can see the full interaction and gesticulation of Mark Kermode.</p>
<p>I’m not the kind of person who seeks out reviews for films I want to watch. If the trailer or word-of-mouth suggests it’s good or interesting I’ll give it a go. But I <em>do</em> like comparing reviews of films that I’ve seen because it’s good to get others’ perspectives, particularly the views of people who are actually immersed in film as viewers.</p>
<p>I mostly agree with Mark Kermode’s views but the interesting point, which I’ve yet to really explain, is that I don’t mind when we disagree. Partly because he is often very clear that the context of any film review is as subjective as the film-going experience: personal mood, expectations, comfortable seating, well, it all makes a difference. His reviews are as coloured by that subjectivity as mine are so we both have a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p>Of course one of the real delights about any critic is to see them really slating something. Not a film that they think is not much fun but something they think is really terrible — which for Mark Kermode generally means “a Michael Bay movie”.</p>

<p>So I invite you to watch his review of Michael Bay’s live-action <em>Transformers</em> movie. And despite being a fan of the 80s cartoon feature he briefly mentions I thought this was a terrible movie.</p>
