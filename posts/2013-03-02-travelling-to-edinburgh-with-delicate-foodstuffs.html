<h2>Travelling to Edinburgh with delicate foodstuffs</h2>
<section>
<p>For our (approximately) monthly (kind of) book group we visit everyone’s flat in rotation and we’re the only people who don’t live in Edinburgh but still attend, so we do a lot of travelling to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The Glasgow underground trains stop at about 6.30pm on a Sunday so we generally take our bikes at least some of the distance so we can cycle back to the flat when we get back to Glasgow Queen Street station.</p>
<p>So we have to come up with food which travels well, and can cope with being beaten a bit on the back of a bike. But no! Tomorrow we’re going to try a new trick. First we cycle to the train station (which handily has both subway and intercity train services) and get the underground back to the flat, with a return ticket. Then we take the food, carefully, on the underground back out to the station and go to Edinburgh.</p>
<p>When we return in the evening we will have only empty dishes and can hop on the bikes heading home. It’s a bit of extra to-ing and fro-ing but I suspect it will work admirably.</p>
