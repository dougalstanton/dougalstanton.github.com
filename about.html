<h2>All About Me</h2>
<section>
<p>My name’s Dougal. I live in Glasgow in the rainy west coast of Scotland and write software for a living. When not at a computer I like <a href="http://www.maonochao.org" title="Mao No Chao - Capoeira Angola Scotland">playing capoeira</a> and baking bread. (Anyone interested in that should seek out Richard Bertinet’s first book, <em>Dough</em>.) I have dabbled in British Sign Language in the past but I no longer get a chance to practise so it’s all disappearing, like my secondary school French.</p>
<p>Professionally I have been involved in embedded development in C and C++. In my spare time I dabble in Haskell and reading up on the things which learning Haskell has thrown my way: type systems, category theory, abstract algebras, program calculation and proof by construction, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to get in touch about this blog or any particular entries, just email <code>dougal</code> at this domain. For recruitment please see <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dougal-stanton/26/bb5/976" title="Dougal Stanton on LinkedIn">my LinkedIn profile</a> for information and contact details.</p>
