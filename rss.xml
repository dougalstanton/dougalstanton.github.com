    <title>XML Starlet (that's what she sed)</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-12-09-xml-starlet-%28that%27s-what-she-said%29.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The stream editor <code>sed</code> is a great tool for automating text editing — replacing names, date or other statements in a high-speed, programmable fashion.</p>
<p>One thing it isn’t really cut out for is XML because the structure of XML is not line-oriented. If you want to automate XML editing quickly I totally recommend <a href="http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net" title="XML Starlet Command Line XML Toolkit">XML Starlet</a> for the job. You can replace node names, attributes, values and so on nested deep inside an XML document while paying full heed to namespaces and such.</p>
<p>On top of that it also lets you see a simple overview and to select values out of documents. Once you get the hang of it you can do some really nice things. I recently got it to rewrite some version numbers inside an Eclipse <code>.cproject</code> file and the resulting script is about as readable and concise as you could hope for.</p>
<p>Looking at the examples I have barely touched the surface of what can be done with this tool but I’m already pretty impressed with what can be achieved.</p>]]></description>

    <title>What is capoeira anyway?</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-12-01-what-is-capoeira-anyway.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Doing something obscure like capoeira comes with the risk of being asked what it is. Unlike karate or BASE jumping or African drumming the answer is neither common knowledge nor easily to summarise. Nestor Capoeira called it the dance–fight–game, which I will go out on a limb as being a pretty atrocious description while at the same time being totally true. Work that one out.</p>
<p>I have previously called it “an Afro-Brazilian martial art crossing the boundaries of game, dance, ritual and fight”, which is not much better to be honest. It just expands on Nestor’s definition by adding the word <em>ritual</em> in there.</p>
<p>The various elements all vying for inclusion in a good description — movement, music, play, acrobatics, song, ritual, fight, dance — are just as much in opposition in definition as they are in capoeira itself. What is playful about a fight? What is ritualised about play? What is acrobatic about song? What is musical about movement?</p>
<p>Maybe the answer is to describe only what you see. It is a game of two people in a circle of others. The crowd who form the circle produce music which dictates the mood of the activity in the circle. The two inside move to the rhythms, controlling the space and responding to each others’ movements. The interaction can be aggressive or playful and is often both in quick succession. The game ends when either players or music stop. There are no points to be tallied or need to decide a winner: it is played for the sake of the game itself.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Closed-doors training sessions</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-25-closed-doors-training-sessions.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve finallly got a space for training capoeira on Tuesdays in Glasgow, but neither Nick or Piolho can commit until at least the new year so we’re going to use it as a “private” session for extra practice rather than a formal teaching opportunity. It’ll just be a few of us going over what we did in previous lessons and getting the chance to play more often.</p>
<p>It looks like the first time around will have only 3 attendees, which is an awkward number for a paired activity.</p>
<p>There are some things I want to work on, either just for myself or because I think it will be an interesting thing to explore. I want to look at some of the strategic sides of the game — possession of space, <a href="http://angoleiro.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/is-your-corpo-fechado/" title="Is Your Corpo Fechado? by Angoleiro">corpo fechado</a> and creative thinking. I think using the money game to explore the first idea is interesting because it’s all about controlling a specific area of play.</p>
<p>I’m also thinking about a kind of “musical statues” thing to encourage thinking about stability and protective postures but that’s something I want to flesh out in my head more before I suggest it to others.</p>
<p>But first I think we should just start with the basics: a straight-forward sequence and some extended play. I must remember to pack the pandeiro.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Life as a game, measured in blog posts and coffee spoons</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-18-life-as-a-game-measured-in-blog-posts.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve tried in the past to get into tools like <a href="http://www.fitocracy.com" title="Fitocracy, levelling-up your fitness?">Fitocracy</a>, whose gimmick is to make exercise a game in which you increase your high score by recording the physical workouts you do. I failed to get much satisfaction out of it for a couple of key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>My cycling doesn’t really change, so while I do about 9 miles a day it never goes above that. The total miles covered keeps going up, which does afford more points, but I feel a bit of a fraud all along. I’m not getting faster and I’m not increasing my distance either.</li>
<li>Capoeira is a dynamic skill-based activity which does not lend itself to measurement with simple numbers like distance, time, mass or speed. To use an analogy, if I could run around really fast and hit tennis balls really hard neither of these would demonstrate I was progressing at tennis. Similarly someone with a less impressive serve and a slower dash could still trounce me if they had actual tennis experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still have a Fitocracy account but I don’t do things which measure easily so I never use it.</p>
<p>Nick recently posted on this, <a href="http://harveynick.com/blog/2013/09/14/am-i-winning/" title="Some thoughts on Gamification">expanding the notion from simple fitness</a> to diverse aspects of life.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Dividing your pie, a problem of lunchtime fairness</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-17-dividing-your-pie.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We were sitting at the table recently with a thin slice of lemon tart from the Italian deli round the corner. The slice was too thin to cut into two similar wedges without it all going horribly wrong. So the question arose, where do you have to cut a wedge of pie across the way if you want to end up with two equal-sized (but not equal-shaped) chunks.</p>
<p>First we need some basic definitions. The area of the original whole tart when it was freshly baked is <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>π</mi><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math>, the area of a circle. We can tell what the radius of the tart is by measuring the wedge from the thinnest point (which would have been at the centre of the tart) to the crust at the outside.</p>
<p>We are trying to find the location to cut a smaller circle which has the same origin of the larger circle. The total area of the smaller circle is exactly half of the larger circle, so any two wedges with the same arc angle will be related in this ratio — the wedge from the smaller circle will be exactly one half the area of the larger wedge. The radius of the smaller circle is the distance from the origin (which both circles share) to the outer edge of the smaller circle. This is the point where we’d cut across the larger wedge to divide them in two. We want to know the smaller radius, having measured the larger radius.</p>
<p>We will call the small unknown radius <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow></math> and the large known radius <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></math>. We start with the basic fact that the area of the large circle is two times the area of the small circle.</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mi>π</mi><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math></p>
<p>Both sides of the equation involve <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>π</mi></mrow></math> so we can feel reasonable cancelling that, and dividing both sides by two.</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mfrac><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>2</mn></mfrac></mrow></math></p>
<p>We can see <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math> in terms of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></math> now, so all we need is to take the square root of both sides.</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mfrac><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>2</mn></mfrac></msqrt></mrow></math></p>
<p>Once we’ve measured the side of the slice of tart we’ve got it’s very simple to determine the fairest place to cut it. Assuming the tart was baked in a 20cm dish then <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></math>.</p>
<p><math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mfrac><msup><mn>10</mn><mn>2</mn></msup><mn>2</mn></mfrac></msqrt><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mn>50</mn></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>.</mo><mn>07</mn></mrow></math></p>
<p>The distance from point to cut is a little over 7cm.</p>]]></description>

    <title>That's not my bag baby (my bag's gone missing)</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-09-thats-not-my-bag-baby.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday on the way to work the train was really busy so I put my rucksack in the overhead storage space… and forgot about it. I remembered at the exact moment that the final carriage was moving past me as I stood on the platform at Linlithgow station.</p>
<p>I reported the loss at the desk in Linlithgow train station and they phoned ahead to Waverley where the train was to terminate. I left my details and they phoned later to say that nothing had been found.</p>
<p>I phoned Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street lost property offices several times over the day to see if anything had been handed in by a passenger but no such luck. Apart from the rucksack itself I’ve lost:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wallet with two bank cards, a driving licence, some stamps and ten pounds in cash; and a coin purse with about four quid in small change. There will be other stuff in the wallet that I’ve forgotten about that will come to light in future when I realise it’s not available.</li>
<li>A spare battery for my front light and an Allen key multitool to deal with any bikey problems that may arise on my journey.</li>
<li>A pair of waterproof trousers, borrowed from my mum a few years ago for attending Traquair Fair in the rain and never given back. Sorry!</li>
<li>Also a gel ink pen, two bananas and an apple. That was for my lunch!</li>
</ul>
<p>The wallet is a logistical pain because it leaves me without ready access to cash at a weekend when Helen is away. The loss of the battery is annoying because (i) I just bought those lights and (ii) I spent extra on the pack with the spare battery which I never got to use.</p>
<p>A day later and neither lost property office has anything which matches my description so I will have to resign myself to cancelling, renewing and repurchasing various things. I’ve already cancelled the bank cards but now I need to get a replacement driving licence and a new wallet to put everything in. The rucksack wasn’t a great purchase anyway so maybe it’s good that I can replace that with something better for our current needs.</p>
<p>The battery I can do without — it was a spare and they are readily rechargable. (It’s a <a href="http://www.cateye.com/uk/products/detail/HL-EL460RC/" title="300 lumen front light with swappable, USB rechargable battery">CatEye Volt300</a> if you’re interested. As well as being bright it is USB rechargable so I can plug it in at work.) The Allen keys will need replaced because the flat is rapidly filling up with bikes that need maintenance and adjustment. The tool had seven different sizes of key and we have used most of them!</p>
<p>Lack of waterproof trousers will be cold in the short term (I can cycle in shorts if it’s raining) but not something I want to sustain. I don’t have the kind of commute which allows me to get really warm from just pedalling when in the depths of winter.</p>
<p>The loss of the apple and bananas has left me inconsolable.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Roda with Glasgow Senzala and Professor Ouriço</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-09-roda-with-glasgow-senzala-and-professor-ourico.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Glasgow Senzala recently had an open roda and workshop with Professor Ourico<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>. I didn’t make it for the workshop but managed to get there for most of the roda.</p>
<p>I realise only now (about a week later?) that this was probably my first roda as a proper outsider. There was a workshop but I didn’t attend. The group was not an angola group. The leader of the roda was not an angoleiro. I think every roda I have attended in the past at least one of these things has been familiar to me but this time round everything was foreign.</p>
<p>At the time I felt very unsure how much I should “remain true” and how much I should try to compromise for the capoeira that was, to some degree, expected. The music was very fast — should I play fast all the time? That’s not really something I can sustain. I realised soon that it wasn’t something that other people could manage.</p>
<p>The “speed dating” approach to capoeira (as Simon described it, at least) left me unsure how interact. I felt rude buying into a game before it really got started; but then if I didn’t buy in somebody else would and then I’d never get to play. Once I’d cut in there was no chance for the game to warm up and develop; it was just straight in there full speed ahead all the time. And while there may be a time and a place for that I really missed the chance to play a decent length game. (Of course it re-emphasised what I feel is good about the slow development and slower games. I often struggle not to push things to the next level so this is a lesson I would do well to learn!)</p>
<p>I also felt unsure around so many people who seemed unsure themselves, or at least were obviously not experts. Was I being too harsh/aggressive? I’m not a very unpredictable player by any means but unfamiliarity makes everything seem twice as unpredictable — they didn’t know me and I didn’t know them. They moved differently so I had a harder time telling the relative levels of expertise.</p>
<p>It’s a tricky one but overall I would definitely like to go for more rodas there because they did things so differently.</p>

    <title>Writing: from LaTeX to nae tech</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-04-writing-from-latex-to-nae-tech.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve always been quite fond of <a href="http://www.latex-project.org" title="LaTeX: A document preparation system">LaTeX</a> as an environment for composing long text, particularly since you can use whichever text editor you prefer and aren’t tied to any particular user interface. The output is also pretty high quality.</p>
<p>The downsides can’t be ignored, however. The language itself is one of those tales which grew in the telling — the result being a Turing complete macro language which isn’t really designed as a programming language but nor is it a particularly friendly markup language.</p>
<p>Also since most people use the LaTeX system on top of TeX there’s a certain degree to which the two are confused. There is no clean layer of abstraction since you can mix the two freely (to confusing result, in many cases).</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been using LaTeX as a backend for final document production but composing all of the documents themselves in Markdown-formatted text files. The conversion from one to the other comes courtesy of <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" title="Markup format-conversion swiss-army knife">PanDoc</a>, which is frankly the greatest thing since jammy pieces.</p>
<p>I’ve just finished putting together a nice system for writing letters using the two, which <a href="https://github.com/dougalstanton/scripts" title="Repository of little scripts and tools">I’ve uploaded to GitHub</a> alongside some instructions. The basic idea is that you drop the three files in your <code>~/bin</code> and the private <code>.pandoc</code> directory. There are a couple of places you should configure to enter your own settings, such as your name and home address.</p>
<p>The result uses the LaTeX “letter” document class to create nice PDFs without you needing to remember how the LaTeX nonsense works. You just type in some basic paragraphs, maybe without formatting of any kind, and the two systems deal with everything for you.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>---
to-name: Santa
to-address: [Santa Claus, Santa&#39;s Grotto, The North Pole]
---

I know it&#39;s only February but I&#39;ve been
very good this year and would like to put
in my request early. It would be great if
you could fix those potholes on Leith Walk
because frankly they&#39;re beyond a joke.</code></pre>
<p>If you leave out the “to-name” field it uses “Dear Sir or Madam” and closes with “Yours faithfully” automatically. I suppose the next step would be to customise the greeting and closing so you could write less formal letters (“Yours sincerely” is about as friendly as it gets) but that’s not much of a priority. If you’re going to write something casual you can probably write it by hand!</p>
<p>I’ve done a quick test recreating some letters I wrote in the past. Hardly the most rigorous of testing regimes but the principle is proven I think and I’ll definitely be using it in future.</p>]]></description>

    <title>One job ends and another begins</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-11-01-one-job-ends-and-another-begins.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>On the 1st of November I finish my job working at Honeywell Security Group and will be moving to Calnex Solutions. I don’t yet know what my new role will involve, only in the broadest of terms. Whatever comes up during discussions at interview is only ever the simplest explanation that fits the moment. The devil is in the details.</p>
<p>I will be commuting further (but faster, so the distance won’t make much difference). Eventually we hope to return to our home in Edinburgh, if Helen and I end up working on the east coast. I will still be travelling by bike and I hope the environment will be nicer!</p>
<p>I hope to keep in touch with some of the people at Honeywell and maybe see them over Christmas for a chat in the pub or similar.</p>
<p>But in the mean time I will have to get used to a new routine with the pain of settling into a new job, learning new things and so forth. Wish me luck.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Public speaking and presentation: post match analysis</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2013-10-26-public-speaking-post-match-analysis.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>My recent <a href="/posts/2013-10-13-aaargh-public-speaking.html" title="Previous thoughts (anxiety) on public speaking">foray into the realm of public speaking</a> went really well. I presented what was initially going to be a 30 minute talk on functional programming, which in the end last for closer to 45 minutes.</p>
<p>During development the topic changed from Haskell to functional programming in general to, ultimately, code reuse. I used Haskell as an example language to show ways in which custom control-flow operations (from the basic <code>map</code> and <code>fold</code> to the more abstract <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) lets you write less code with more consistent semantics and pave the way for parallelising code if necessary.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/dougalstanton/intro-to-fp/" title="Source for slides and notes">slides and notes are available on GitHub</a>. Both documents are written in Markdown. I used Pandoc with support for the Reveal.js presentation framework to create a slick set of slides. (I think the look of the slides came across really well, compared to the usual Powerpoint fare.)</p>
<p>I wrote most of the presentation in prose format to begin with so that I had my ideas fully formed. I think this really helped form a cohesive story. In the past I’ve gone straight from “half-baked idea” to “creating slides” and it has been really easy to become confused about what I should be saying at each stage. Coming up with an initial story meant that I really knew what I was trying to say and most of the time knew what slide was coming up next without peeking.</p>
<p>I am definitely more influenced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method" title="Minimal full-screen slides in the style of Masayoshi Takahashi">Takahashi</a> and Lessig schools of presentation authoring — really minimising the amount of stuff on screen. The other important thing is not to read what is on screen. I think this is where coming up with a narrative first was really helpful: the slides I produced in the end were illustrations of my words, rather than the words being descriptions of my illustrations.</p>
<p>Obviously the totally-minimalist presentation style isn’t appropriate if you want to show code, which often requires four or five lines of text. But it’s still much better than two columns of small text with bullet points and a graph all on screen at once.</p>
<p>One thing I did learn from the actual presentation on the day — apart from the need to assume technical difficulties with the projector — is that the colour and detail you get projected onto the wall (even in a dark room) is much worse than the slides on your screen. I did a test run with the television at home but that still didn’t give me a proper idea how bad the final display would be. Err on the side of thicker lines and greater contrast between colours. I had one tree diagram illustrating an inverted tree. The branches of the tree were just black lines and became totally invisible when projected despite looking fine on my screen and on our television.</p>
<p>The total experience for me was a lot more relaxed than I was expecting. Whether this was due to good preparation, confidence in my knowledge of the subject, more self-confidence or other things that I can’t pinpoint right now, we’ll never know. I felt really in control and for the rest of the day was on a total high.</p>
<p>The feedback on the presentation was also very positive — that it ran at a measured pace, I didn’t seem flustered or get myself confused, I didn’t try to say five things at once and so on. In general people seemed to believe that I was in control, which in this instance I really felt I was. A miracle.</p>]]></description>
