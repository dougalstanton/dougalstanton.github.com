    <title>Cycling like your granny</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-01-12-cycling-like-your-granny.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>At the weekend I ventured out into some pretty foul weather for a trip to Hermiston Gait<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. According to Google Maps I could follow the NEPN for a chunk and get there in forty minutes. I set off at a relaxed pace and got lost. (I see now that I followed my nose and headed west along the Water of Leith at one point when I should have headed east and curved back on the cycle path.) But I had a successful shopping trip and was largely stress free while doing it.</p>
<p>It was my first visit to Hermiston Gait and Edinburgh Park station. In the summer I can definitely see myself hopping off the train there for a gentle ride back into town. The new shared path that runs alongside the tram is really relaxing compared to the stress of road travel. Cycling as it should be.</p>
<p>On my return journey I came a more direct route — past Haymarket, along Shandwick Place and into George Street before home. It was still raining and I was passed several times by cyclists in a hurry. I was trying my best to remain at a sedate pace; all the off-road travel I was doing certainly helped.</p>
<p>There’s a phrase on the City Cycling Edinburgh forums about <a href="http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/topic.php?id=5723" title="National &#39;ride like your gran&#39; day">“cycling like your granny”</a>. This amounts to <em>not</em> battling with traffic and seeing how you travel. Limiting yourself to 10mph or coasting otherwise. The weekend’s trip on quiet segregated routes helped bring me closer to the relaxed mood I would have to be in to ride like that all the time.</p>

    <title>Teaching styles in capoeira and BJJ</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-01-09-teaching-capoeira-bjj.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been about two months now since I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so I’ve got a better understanding of how it’s being taught now.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed with the teaching at Cross Combat, and I can tell it’s something that William and his team take a fair amount of pride in. It seems to rely on a few fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on one thing per class</li>
<li>Building technique piecemeal</li>
<li>Progressive resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing that seems outlandish, unusual or revolutionary but the reality is that it’s <em>productive</em>. On top of this there is some philosophical approach which emphasises exploration and flow over exacting instruction.</p>
<p>The attitude is very similar to the teaching in capoeira (at least, in Mão No Chão) but the actual teaching is very different structure is very different. We definitely <em>don’t</em> focus on a single thing during a lesson — a scattergun approach would be a more accurate description.</p>
<p>I think we try for progressive resistance but miss the full value. We can start off very collaborative but there’s no steady progression from there. A predictable next step for each level of resistance would be valuable to have: in this way it’s always obvious how the other person will react. On that topic a prohibition against <em>malicia</em> and <em>malandragem</em> during training until it’s explicitly allowed. Indeed, that is a level of resistance that can be saved for an actual game.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the Christmas holidays and several weeks since I’ve done any capoeira or been to a class. I’m going to rethink everything I have written here in light of what we actually do the next time I train.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Happy to agree, happy to disagree</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-12-31-happy-to-agree-happy-to-disagree.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been watching a lot of clips recently from the Mark Kermode/Simon Mayo review slot on Radio 5 Live. The radio reviews are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kermodeandmayo/" title="Kermode &amp; Mayo&#39;s Film Reviews">filmed and broadcast on their Youtube channel</a> so you can see the full interaction and gesticulation of Mark Kermode.</p>
<p>I’m not the kind of person who seeks out reviews for films I want to watch. If the trailer or word-of-mouth suggests it’s good or interesting I’ll give it a go. But I <em>do</em> like comparing reviews of films that I’ve seen because it’s good to get others’ perspectives, particularly the views of people who are actually immersed in film as viewers.</p>
<p>I mostly agree with Mark Kermode’s views but the interesting point, which I’ve yet to really explain, is that I don’t mind when we disagree. Partly because he is often very clear that the context of any film review is as subjective as the film-going experience: personal mood, expectations, comfortable seating, well, it all makes a difference. His reviews are as coloured by that subjectivity as mine are so we both have a get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p>Of course one of the real delights about any critic is to see them really slating something. Not a film that they think is not much fun but something they think is really terrible — which for Mark Kermode generally means “a Michael Bay movie”.</p>
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/v0d6G1X278s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>So I invite you to watch his review of Michael Bay’s live-action <em>Transformers</em> movie. And despite being a fan of the 80s cartoon feature he briefly mentions I thought this was a terrible movie.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Not the worst Christmas ever!</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-12-26-not-the-worst-christmas-ever.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I spend Christmas day alone in the flat, cooking. For the first time I prepared a full meal for both sets of parents — our usual Christmas routine was abandoned because Helen was working until 6pm and started again on Boxing Day. Spending days away from the house was not an option.</p>
<p>I opted to cook venison instead of turkey. One, because it would mean I wasn’t playing to a rule-book and could remove items that I’m not keen on (sprouts, parsnips) without alarming anyone. Licence to play by my own rules! Also I’m not sure how well a turkey to feed seven would fit in our oven and still leave room for cooking roast potatoes, sausages and anything else required.</p>
<p>This is the first time we’ve had both sets of parents together for a sit down meal, for some reason. It went pretty well and the food was well-received. If anything we over-catered (there’s still a lot of red cabbage left over and even the small amount of broccoli wasn’t finished).</p>
<p>Due to time constraints we didn’t finish the present-opening. Helen and I still have things to give each other but I think (hope) everything that was due for other people went away with them.</p>
<p>Excuse me, I have more cold roast potatoes to eat.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Capoeira breakdown</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-10-19-capoeira-breakdown.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been adding lots of new things to the <a href="http://maonochao.org" title="Mao No Chao Capoeira Scotland">Mão no Chão website</a> — with a perticular emphasis on things which have seemed important to my understanding of capoeira or that have seemed related. Talking about capoeira through other means seems so much easier than talking about capoeira in a straightforward way. (This, I think, is a very capoeira way of approaching the problem.)</p>
<p>One thing which I haven’t seen anywhere but that I’d like to see is a game breakdown. All the big sporting events get expert commentary but capoeira misses out on this — there is some academic work into the history and cultural ramifications of the art but very little covering particular instances.</p>
<p>Contrast with an article like <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2014/7/4/5869847/ufc-175-lyoto-machida-chris-weidman-mind-control-mma-technique-karate-ko-gif">Lyoto Machida’s Mind Control</a> which provides a detailed analysis of the tactics that one fighter is using to control his opponent. That is some very fine and detailed analysis and I’ve not seen anything <em>close</em> when it comes to capoeira.</p>
<p>I suppose the only answer is to do it. Stop moping about and sit down with a video of a game, watch it, watch it again, think about it, watch it in slow motion, watch it backwards — whatever it takes to make sense of everything that’s happening.</p>]]></description>

    <title>First lesson in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-09-27-first-lesson-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Why BJJ? It seems interesting and it seems safe. As fascinating as boxing is it’s a clean straight path to head trauma and brain damage. BJJ, like its close cousin judo, focuses clearly on being able to stress test without causing any undue damage. (Famous last words. We’ll see what my knees can still do when I’m sixty.)</p>
<p>I went to a class at <a href="http://crosscombat.co.uk" title="BJJ, Wrestling and Kickboxing">CrossCombat</a> in Tollcross after work on Thursday, just above the Scotmid near the King’s Theatre. I arrived while they’d been doing some warm-up so didn’t see what the beginning of class looked like. And given the timings I may rarely see the class start — it just takes slightly too long to get from Haymarket station.</p>
<p>After being led through a short warm-up (standard jogging, side-steps and so on) I joined the rest of the class for a warm-up free-play, trying to maintain dominance then onto the first teaching moment, the scarf hold. Initially I was just trying to maintain the hold while my partner would escape. The people on top moved round trying out the move on different partners, then the two roles reversed. Being underneath was exhausting and felt very vulnerable. It was amazing how much weight some people seemed to exert though they looked (and claimed) to be pretty slim.</p>
<p>Next round was transitioning from the scarf hold to a north-south choke. This was more than a little daunting and even the feeling of the choke being clamped on — never mind taking effect — is quite debilitating. Also it tends to happen with your nose in some sweaty dude’s armpit which isn’t cool either.</p>
<p>Thereafter my brain hit overload, so took the executive decision to ignore all the “then you could do this, or this, or this” suggestions as clearly not aimed at me. If I could even remember the scarf hold by the end of the day it would be a miracle never mind all the other transitions. Walk don’t run.</p>
<p>The end of class was more free play though this time I had something I could positively focus on. Each person I sparred with gave me a little tip or piece of general advice: “keep your body close so you don’t give space to manoeuvre”; “turn so you’re facing your opponent when they try to move”; “keep your hands close and tight if mounted”; “relax so you don’t tire yourself out”.</p>
<p>The last point was the only one where I thought to myself, “hang on a minute, that’s not fair”. I admit outright that it makes total sense and with expertise comes the ability to relax into the game. But the game here is about positioning and since I really didn’t know what were good positions or transitions to get into them my only real intention was to frustrate the efforts of whoever I was sparring with. Without a plan of my own, I could only resist the plans of my partner. Given time I hope to relax into the situation. Then I will feel less like my muscles were given such a pummeling.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Celebrating new bike day with a Fuji Track Classic</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-08-22-celebrating-new-bike-day.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a long time coming but the combination of new city, new routines and a bike shop sale was enough for me to pull the trigger on a new bike — a fixed gear Fuji Track Classic. The alternative was a Charge Plug which was over £100 dearer and I didn’t think an experiment like this warranted the extra money. (Besides, I have heard more positive, or fewer negative, things said about the Fuji than the Charge bike.)</p>
<p>This is my first time with a fixed gear bike, which has been both an alarming, eye-opening, surprising and incredibly gratifying experience. I rode it (mostly) home from the shop on Monday night, which was a daunting first ride. I admit to stopping and walking it on a few of the downhill stretches because I wasn’t feeling so confident.</p>
<p>Geometrically it’s a lot more aggressive than my Ridgeback hybrid. Getting down into the drops does feel very exciting and provides an extra impression of speed. The ride is also pretty silent with no chain rattle, no jockey wheels, no creaking of mudguards or rack. For the first time I could just hear the rubber of the tyres on the road… how odd! On top of that the ride is buttery smooth. Is this the wheels, the frame design, the steel? I don’t know but I really like it.</p>
<p>Riding is a more measured and considered affair than the hybrid — getting up to speed takes longer and once you’re at speed it feels like the bike wants to stay there. The lack of coasting gives you a more nuanced impression of what the bike is doing — it is easy for bike and rider to unsynchronise when you’re pedalling through a freewheel.</p>
<p>(I am conscious that I’m anthropomorphising here. The bike does this, the bike wants that. I think because it feels wilful in its awkwardness sometimes. If you don’t settle right then you can dislodge yourself — that feels very much like you’ve just been thrown from the back of an animal. It looks like a bike but it doesn’t behave like a bike ought to, so clearly it’s being deliberately unco-operative.)</p>
<p>So how does the continual pedal pedal pedal actually feel? So far it has not been the difficult part of adjusting. As I increase the distance covered that might change. Finishing a ride feels fantastic which might be down to the endorphin buzz of the non-stop pushing; it’s not something I am conscious of when cycling with a freewheel.</p>
<p>The single gear has also not been too much of a problem. I am slowly adjusting to new personal guidelines, the most important of which is “don’t stop halfway up”. Hill climbing — particularly long steady hills — seem easier (or certainly no harder) but starting on a hill is much less fun!</p>
<p>My only regret is the colour! It’s a great looking bike but it’s gonna really show up the road dirt soon enough. I will need to have baby wipes to hand at all times. Happy riding!</p>]]></description>

    <title>Cycling to the Borders</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-08-12-cycling-to-the-borders.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I went on my first solo long-distance ride recently, from Edinburgh to Melrose, about 45 miles in total. The sky was largely cloudless and the wind non-existent. Apart from the dangers of dehydration and sunburn it was perfect weather for cycling.</p>
<p>Getting out of Edinburgh took too long. I started using <a href="http://www.cyclestreets.net" title="CycleStreets: cycle maps">the CycleStreets app</a> which didn’t give me any vocal directions. I was stopping on every street corner to check if I’d gone too far or needed to make a turn. Eventually the app lost my location entirely and then crashed. After restarting it was unable to continue from my current location and I was entirely sick of the whole thing. I was conscious that I had left later than I intended and every minute spent faffing with this app was a minute I wasn’t moving.</p>
<p>I fired up Google Maps and navigated the rest of the way with the Navigation feature, including voice instructions. My phone was in the back pocket of my jersey so it wasn’t always easy to hear what the voice was saying but this was still better than no voice at all. In future I would use headphones and have the nearside earbud in for instructions while keeping the other ear open for traffic.</p>
<p>I was trying to stop as little as possible so didn’t really lunch. I had two sandwiches and a caramel wafer with me but didn’t take the time to halt and rest properly. This was (obviously) a mistake. I should also have stopped somewhere to get a water refill. Instead I wasted time trying to get through the back entrance to Dalkeith Country Park. It seems to be part of NCN1 but had been padlocked. Thankfully a driver was there waiting for someone to let him through and he helped me <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@55.921969,-3.060568,3a,75y,118.13h,84.08t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1s146hJKISFpgm-Qk0gE7_aw!2e0">lift the bike over the 7ft gate</a> into the park.</p>
<p>There were several good stretches of path coming out of Edinburgh to the east and heading south past Musselburgh and through Dalkeith. From there I was in the hills above the A7 almost the whole way to Galashiels. The roads were really quiet but in excellent condition — at no point did I feel stressed by the traffic while travelling through the hills. It was just me and the inclines and the declines.</p>
<p>The pain started to kick in about forty minutes from my destination. My little toe stopped appreciating the pressure from the pedalling action inside my shoe. The long hours in the saddle took their toll. I felt really relieved during the last stretch into Melrose, down hill all the way and clear of cars.</p>
<p>I rolled past the Melrose town markers at bang on 6 o’clock, some 4¼ hours after leaving the house. The average speed for the whole journey was about 10mph but this isn’t at all indicative of actual travelling speeds. The first hour was so stop-start I probably did less than 5mph whereas there were sections on freshly laid A7 with a tailwind where I’d be travelling more than 20mph. In future I’ll remember to use an app which tracks location and time and speed properly.</p>
<p>It was an amazing ride and I am much wiser now about the availability of cycle-friendly roads and trails. The obvious next step is to do a similar route but take more time: time to admire the scenery; time to take photos; time to eat lunch; time to deviate from the path if a tea room or interesting tourist attraction is signposted. Time to <a href="http://bikeridebooks.co.uk/a-bit-scott-ish/">hunt down that lemon drizzle cake</a>.</p>]]></description>

    <title>How many bicycles is too many?</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-08-05-how-many-bicycles-is-too-many.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The saying goes that you always need one more bike than you have. Well, initially I didn’t think I needed a bike at all but that assumption turned out to be wrong<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Since then I’ve been discovering the ways in which my one bikes can help me out. Commuting every day, taking less time and able to carry much more to and from work. Carrying incredible amounts of shopping easily from the supermarket to home. Going on holiday for a week in Islay and Arran entirely under our own steam. Jetting across town to meet people, visit places and get around quickly.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#12" title="You always need one more bike">incredibly serious Rules</a> tell us that we always need another bike and I’m slowly coming to the conclusion that when you own 1 bike you probably need 2. (I will hold off judgement on the full implication.) My current bike plays the role of the generalist very well but I’m looking to specialise a bit. My long term plan is essentially to split my current bike into two bikes — one playing the role of the heavy duty workhorse that will let me get the shopping, take a full load of panniers on the road and be equipped for long journeys. The other would play the role of something light and simple for local riding, when I just want to jump on the bike and go.</p>
<p>I’ve been conscious for some time that I don’t get to wear some of my clothes when I’m cycling. Cycling wear ends up meaning technical wear when I leave the house and I want to stop that. I don’t walk to the shops with hiking boots and a pole so why should I cycle with the equivalent? Now that’s not to say I actually do <a href="http://edinburghcyclechic.wordpress.com/" title="Because you don&#39;t have to wear Lycra">wear lycra to hop on the bike</a> —</p>
<p>To that end I’ve been looking at something a bit minimalist and more stylish. It doesn’t always have to be about hard work, after all. I really like the idea of slim single-speed bike with none of the mess that I have on my current bike to spoil the look. I fear in practise that things like weather, luggage, lights and so on will minimise the extent to which this can be achieved. We don’t all live in California… but I’ve been putting some thought to what it would mean if we did.</p>

    <title>The Swedish author with the bolt from the blue</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2014-06-25-swedish-bolt-from-the-blue.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve mentioned in the past being unimpressed with <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and suspecting that the translation was a good chunk of the problem. I remember thinking that the prose seemed very cliched and relied heavily on hackneyed sayings that shouldn’t be a part of a well-written novel. Since we can hardly blame the author of the Swedish original for the clunky English phrasing we’ll have to point the finger at the translator.</p>
<p>Maybe you think I’m being unfair. While on holiday recently I had time to read the two sequels and got the same impression with them as I did with the original book. And since they’re fresh in my mind I still remember some of the dodgy phrases. Let’s see if I can demonstrate some problems.</p>
<p>The English translations seem very fond of describing sudden events in the same lumpen way. There’s a couple from the first book, though not the only ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The question came like a bolt out of the blue, but Berger did not seem the least bit surprised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Forgive me for bothering you out of the blue, but I happened to be in St. Albans, and I tried to call you during the day.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the sequel, <em>The Girl who Played with Fire</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then out of the blue she had destroyed him. She had struck back with a power and determination that he had not dreamed she possessed. She had humiliated him. She had tortured him. She had all but demolished him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hedström said nothing during the taxi journey from Slussen to Kungsholmen. He was in a daze from out of the blue ending up in a real police investigation. He glanced at Bohman, who was reading Armansky’s presentation again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And finally from <em>The Girl who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Annika… this isn’t the way I had planned to end my time at Millennium. In the middle of chaos. But the offer came like a bolt from the blue, and I can’t say no. I mean, it’s the chance of a lifetime. I got the offer just before Dag and Mia were shot, and there’s been such turmoil here that I buried it. And now I have the world’s worst guilty conscience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At 6:00 she paid her bill and walked to Lillian’s place on Olivedalsgatan. She punched in the door code her friend had given her. She stepped into the stairwell and was looking for a light switch when the attack came out of the blue. She was slammed up against a tiled wall next to the door. She banged her head hard, felt a rush of pain, and fell to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you begin to see what I’m talking about. You read these phrases — and others like “within a few minutes he would be dead as a door-nail” — and wonder to yourself what the translator and editor were doing. There are dozens like these and they often break the illusion. Who carefully describes a method of killing someone that will result in them being “dead as a door-nail”?</p>
<p>It gives hope for the rest of us. Between dodgy translations of Stieg Larsson and the top-notch output of Dan Brown there’s room for everyone in the airport thriller market, whether you can write or not.</p>]]></description>
