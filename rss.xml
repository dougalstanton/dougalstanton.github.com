    <title>Lower gear on Fuji for Edinburgh's hills</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-05-03-lower-gear-on-the-fuji-for-edinburghs-hills.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The stock Fuji Track Classic comes with a 46/16 gear ratio, which works out at <a href="http://www.bikecalc.com/gear_inches">about 76 gear inches</a>. This is pretty good on a flat road. Riding across the work car park or along George Street is very relaxing. What it’s not great for is Edinburgh’s sharp inclines, particularly without a head start. Getting the initial forward movement on the hill in such a high gear is pretty harsh!</p>
<p>The solution then was to adjust the gear to something a bit lower. Replacing the 16 tooth cog with an 18T produces 67 inches which is a substantial step down. There’s always a trade off in these things and there were two here. The first of course is that a gear which is good for climbing is not good for descending. I must learn to spin faster (though this is always true). The second consideration is chain length since altering the cog size shifts everything around. The move to 18T is the most I can manage with this chain; anything larger would require an extra link in the chain to compensate.</p>
<p>Finally in the process of putting it all together I learned the difference between a fixed hub and a freewheel hub since my bike has one of each. On the fixed side there’s a slightly larger diameter forward-thread to accept the cog and then a smaller diameter section which is reverse threaded. The cog screws in “forward” and the lockring screws in “backward” to prevent the cog coming undone with a hard backpressure.</p>
<p>The other side has only a forward-threaded section: there is no room for a lockring. Opinions differ as to whether this is a bad thing or not. If the cog is wound tightly enough then it shouldn’t be, and each pedal stroke under normal use will tighten the cog further. Personally I would prefer the safety of a lockring and I would have put my new 18T cog on the side which fits the lockring… except I couldn’t get the old 16T off first! It’s had a lot of hard pushing and is quite firmly locked in place.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Char is (probably) not short for Character</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-05-02-char-is-not-short-for-character.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I was reading an online discussion recently about the pronunciation of “char” as it appears in C source code. For the non-programmers, the keyword “char” is used to indicate a character (eg, letter or number) in code, like this:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode c"><code class="sourceCode c"><span class="dt">char</span> my_initial = &#39;D&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Some people pronounce this keyword as it appears, <em>char</em> (as in to blacken by burning). Others pronounce it more like <em>car</em> with a hard /k/ since it’s short for <em>character</em>. But it occured to me that the vowel sound in <em>car</em> and in <em>character</em> are different — at least they are in my accent!</p>
<p>I looked them up and they appear different in IPA rendering too: /ɑ/ in <em>car</em> and /a/ in <em>character</em>.</p>
<p>I’m personally fond of pronouncing it like <em>char</em>, but if I wanted to go with the alternative could I learn to pronounce <em>car</em> with a different vowel sound? How weird would I sound?</p>]]></description>

    <title>Dwelling on a capoeira lesson plan</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-04-15-dwelling-on-a-capoeira-lesson-plan.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>The other night I was kept from sleep by a cold and spent too much brainpower thinking and rethinking how to teach capoeira classes better. I could not sleep and I thought and because I was thinking it took much longer to reach sleep. But at least I had some fruitful thoughts.</p>
<p>The next day I was supposed to help teach a class because the main teachers were away. So while I worried at the problem and failed to get the sleep I needed, daybreak was getting closer and I was getting myself more sick. In the end I was too ill to take the class and it was basically aborted.</p>
<p>So the irony is apparent. I spent so long worrying about doing the class right that I couldn’t do it at all. Would it have been better to take the class under-prepared but less ill, or save the ideas for a future date? I think I made the right choice. I certainly feel like I made the right choice after a long sleep the following night — getting to bed early instead of teaching a class until late was definitely refreshing.</p>
<p>I was particularly worried about beginners to the class, because they’re the people who have the smallest amount of patience for a bad class. The regulars would forgive me if it didn’t all go right and they would return anyway. A beginner is more likely to take one look and walk away if they don’t like it.</p>
<p>Now that I am feeling healthier and less miserable I believe it would have been an okay class after all. At least for a first attempt.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Sports as idle pastimes</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-04-09-sports-as-idle-pastimes.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>We recently spent some holiday time in France with Kirsten, Oliver and other friends in their house. A whole week away from my usual physical routines of cycling, capoeira and grappling. We did a bit of casual cycling in Paris with a tour guide but it was strictly low-speed sight-seeing rather than exercise.</p>
<p>Some of the others in the house went out running and for the first time I was jealous of running. I’m never jealous of running because I don’t enjoy it but this time I wanted the activity, I wanted the camaraderie and I wanted the accessibility of it all.</p>
<p>Cycling can be done solo; some may say it’s best done solo though sharing a view at the top of a hill or a pint at the bottom is surely better than doing the same alone. Grappling obviously requires a (willing?) partner and a bit of soft ground though not necessarily much else. But if you suggest to most people whether they want to have a friendly wrestling match they would probably think you’re cracked.</p>
<p>Finally there’s capoeira, a pastime that has even been called <em>vadiação</em>, bumming around. But if you don’t have a bateria and a group of friends and so on you’ll still need another person who wants to play. That’s probably less likely than finding someone who wants to wrestle with you because most people who grew up with a sibling have at least wrestled before. <em>Nobody</em> knows what capoeira is all about. Bumming around is harder than it seems.</p>
<p>This is why I am jealous of running. A solo sport that you can do in groups and doesn’t need more equipment than what you’re standing in.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Bike fit at Bike Craft (part 2)</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-04-08-bike-fit-at-bike-craft-part-2.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a month since my bike fit and re-adjustment at Bike Craft. Their loaned seat-post was swapped for a shiny new one<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and I’m slowly getting accustomed to the riding position.</p>
<p>I have not gone for any very long rides — nothing longer than my usual trips from Haymarket station or BJJ class. There is still the slightest hint of pain when I push the limits for an extended period but this is what I’d expect. Under normal circumstances I think that <em>should</em> happen: if it doesn’t hurt when you’re going flat out then are you really going flat out?</p>
<p>I can’t remember if I mentioned that the fixed gear bike seems to be set up more like the new configuration of the geared bike than the old configuration. This may explain the lack of pain riding that bike but since the toe traps don’t have any straps to lock my feet laterally onto the pedals I can’t really confirm anything. Maybe if my feet were held in place they would hurt just as much.</p>
<p>It sounds like Helen’s bike might also be a poor fit for her — a poor fit geometrically but also a poor fit for her requirements. I think we’re both coming to the conclusion that a touring/relaxed road bike is most suitable for our needs as an all-purpose machine. That’s certainly what I’d thought would be my next move.</p>
<p>In future I would be hesitant to buy a new bike without a proper bike fit, especially since most places will offset some or all of the cost of the fit against the bike anyway. Why pay money without that assurance?</p>

    <title>Bike fit at Bike Craft (part 1)</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-03-11-bike-fit-at-bike-craft-part-1.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Since I got my first bike as an adult several years ago I noticed that I pedal with my feet on the outside of the pedals, splayed slightly outwards. This wasn’t a particular problem with flat pedals but if I am using toe clips or straps my legs felt uncomfortable and twisted. After a day of cycling I got pain behind my knee, particularly at the back of my right leg.</p>
<p>Doing the research pointed up an issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor_%28bicycles%29" title="Q factor for bicycles">“Q factor”</a>, the distance between the two planes in which the pedals move. Different bike designs (mountain, road, leisure) will differ due to bottom bracket size, the splay of the cranks and so on. But the racier the bike the narrower the distance between your feet.</p>
<p>Reasoning that my natural/desired Q factor was wider than one afforded by the design of my bike, I bought some <a href="http://www.specialized.com/gb/gb/ftb/mtb-components/pedals/body-geometry-pedal-axle-extenders" title="Pedal extenders (larger than life)">pedal extenders</a> — metal cylinders with a pedal-style male thread at one end and a crank-style female thread at the other. This seemed to solve the issue: my foot could be strapped in and I could pedal pedal pedal for hours without pain.</p>
<p>So where is this going? It’s going the way of all hacks, all “self-medication”. The niggling belief that there was something fundamentally wrong with my setup that I was not fixing but shifting elsewhere with the pedal extenders. With every new bike I buy, or every new saddle, or pedals, do I have to go through these experiments?</p>
<p>I arranged a fitting at <a href="http://bikecraftedinburgh.co.uk/" title="Bike Craft, Edinburgh">Bike Craft on Ferry Road</a>. They asked me about my cycling habits and distances, and the all important list of problems and aches I get. Then they set me up on a massage table to measure the flexibility of my hips. I knew this would be pretty terrible; despite the BJJ and capoeira I am still a stiff old board.</p>
<p>With all this data gathered I sat on my own bike on a trainer and made some adjustments, making sure to take before and after measurements. The seatpost was replaced with another that had a smaller offset — since my saddle was at its furthest forward to counteract the existing post’s large rearward offset. The saddle height was reduced. And the pedal extenders were removed.</p>
<p>I’ve got the temporary seatpost on loan for a few days to see how it works with the new height and without the pedal extenders. After all of the adjustments of the evening, and the unfamiliarity of my new riding position, I was unable to definitely say if it was better or worse than my usual position.</p>
<p>Initial impressions are that I feel more “inside” the bike. It feels more likely that I could get a higher cadence in this position, which does hint that I was too far away from the pedals before. I’ll give it a few days and a few more miles to see what happens.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Welcome my Son in full</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-03-07-welcome-my-son-in-full.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Just over a year ago we saw <a href="/posts/2014-02-17-critical-appraisal-from-the-inside.html">Phil, of Spotted Stripes Circus fame, perform the beginnings of something built on the story of Frankenstein</a>. On the first of March I had the considerable pleasure of seeing the first public performance of <em>Welcome my Son</em>.</p>
<p>There was a feedback form, so this is a record of what I wrote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was there any single element that particularly stood out positively?</p>
<p>The physical characterisation of the ‘monster’ was fantastic, particularly the involuntary jerks and convulsions. It was uncomfortable to watch (I found myself flinching in sympathy) and amazing to see that combined with the control to manage it while still hanging on a pole or balancing on the scaffold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Was there any single element that stood out negatively?</p>
<p>The transition from the physical theatre at the start, with just the subtlest of sounds to support it, to a traditional soliloquy, was a bit jarring at first. I hadn’t expected it so I took a minute to adjust to the change in pace.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall what would have made the performance better?</p>
<p>The contrast between the two characters got a bit confused at the finale, when I wasn’t totally clear who was speaking which part until it settled into a rhythm. If that were made clearer it might be easier to understand the climax as it happens rather than needing a moment to reflect on what is going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you go and see this show again?</p>
<p>I don’t normally see shows again but I think if I were to go again I would enjoy re-examining what I saw and looking for new details.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Would you recommend it to anyone else?</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this show — indeed I have already recommended it to someone, though I was not able to say when or if it would next be performed.</p>

    <title>Taking the long way home</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-01-14-taking-the-long-way-home.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I decided I couldn’t face another wrestle with the Calton Road/Leith Street/Picardy Place/Leith Walk snarl-up and decided to find something more relaxed. Every time I looked up cycling to the western edge of Edinburgh there seemed to be a route which skirted the north of the city and came back down about Haymarket. So where was it actually, and could I get there?</p>
<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/241037592/embed/567351eef61b1487465e53d0e8f24cbdcab17ce3'></iframe>

<p>It turns out to be pretty easy to find from Haymarket station — though I did have some help because there was an old guy on a Brompton who was also heading that direction so I just tailgated him. Brompton or not, he quickly disappeared into the distance…</p>
<p>I’m still nursing a sore wrist from earlier in the week, so I was effectively riding “one-handed” (but not really; I could still brake or steer with both if necessary). So I wasn’t really riding <em>fast</em> though when there’s no traffic lights and a decent road surface you can get up a decent pace. From the Strava chart I reckon the uninterrupted section of road was averaging ~25kph — about 15mph.</p>
<p>More importantly the “moving time” was about half an hour — which means in half an hour I can get to Haymarket station without touching the roads, and that’s if I’m not pushing it. I’ve been lamenting that my cycle commute has been getting shorter as the years go by, but I’ve not been willing to do the full ride from flat to office. I’m still too feart of being stranded in the middle of West Lothian somewhere especially in the winter. (And I don’t trust the traffic on that road either.)</p>
<p>This seems like the ideal way to add some more miles to my weekly tally without going crazy.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Cycling like your granny</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-01-12-cycling-like-your-granny.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>At the weekend I ventured out into some pretty foul weather for a trip to Hermiston Gait<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. According to Google Maps I could follow the NEPN for a chunk and get there in forty minutes. I set off at a relaxed pace and got lost. (I see now that I followed my nose and headed west along the Water of Leith at one point when I should have headed east and curved back on the cycle path.) But I had a successful shopping trip and was largely stress free while doing it.</p>
<p>It was my first visit to Hermiston Gait and Edinburgh Park station. In the summer I can definitely see myself hopping off the train there for a gentle ride back into town. The new shared path that runs alongside the tram is really relaxing compared to the stress of road travel. Cycling as it should be.</p>
<p>On my return journey I came a more direct route — past Haymarket, along Shandwick Place and into George Street before home. It was still raining and I was passed several times by cyclists in a hurry. I was trying my best to remain at a sedate pace; all the off-road travel I was doing certainly helped.</p>
<p>There’s a phrase on the City Cycling Edinburgh forums about <a href="http://citycyclingedinburgh.info/bbpress/topic.php?id=5723" title="National &#39;ride like your gran&#39; day">“cycling like your granny”</a>. This amounts to <em>not</em> battling with traffic and seeing how you travel. Limiting yourself to 10mph or coasting otherwise. The weekend’s trip on quiet segregated routes helped bring me closer to the relaxed mood I would have to be in to ride like that all the time.</p>

    <title>Teaching styles in capoeira and BJJ</title>
    <link>http://dougalstanton.net/posts/2015-01-09-teaching-capoeira-bjj.html</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>It’s been about two months now since I started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu so I’ve got a better understanding of how it’s being taught now.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed with the teaching at Cross Combat, and I can tell it’s something that William and his team take a fair amount of pride in. It seems to rely on a few fundamentals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on one thing per class</li>
<li>Building technique piecemeal</li>
<li>Progressive resistance</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing that seems outlandish, unusual or revolutionary but the reality is that it’s <em>productive</em>. On top of this there is some philosophical approach which emphasises exploration and flow over exacting instruction.</p>
<p>The attitude is very similar to the teaching in capoeira (at least, in Mão No Chão) but the actual teaching is very different structure is very different. We definitely <em>don’t</em> focus on a single thing during a lesson — a scattergun approach would be a more accurate description.</p>
<p>I think we try for progressive resistance but miss the full value. We can start off very collaborative but there’s no steady progression from there. A predictable next step for each level of resistance would be valuable to have: in this way it’s always obvious how the other person will react. On that topic a prohibition against <em>malicia</em> and <em>malandragem</em> during training until it’s explicitly allowed. Indeed, that is a level of resistance that can be saved for an actual game.</p>
<p>It’s the end of the Christmas holidays and several weeks since I’ve done any capoeira or been to a class. I’m going to rethink everything I have written here in light of what we actually do the next time I train.</p>]]></description>
