<h2>Capoeira Training Diary</h2>
<section>
<p>I’m just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I’m using forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:</p>
<pre><code>Question / Response
Defence  \ Attack</code></pre>
<p>The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.</p>
<h3 id="section">2013-03-21</h3>
<p>Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular</code></pre>
<p>Ginga with “breaks” — <em>giro</em> (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish), <em>pulo</em> (jump, from side to side), <em>chamada</em> (facing off to one side, legs together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).</p>
<p>Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the other side.</p>
<p>Sequence:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia</code></pre>
<p>Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change direction until Left’s foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to turn into a chapa.</p>
<p>Variant 1:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Variant 2:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Right’s QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs to protect before spreading for the tesoura.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2013-04-04</h3>
<p>Practise ginga: with a firm base and a light expressive top half; and with an agile, light base and a solid top half.</p>
<p>Quite an intricate sequence starting from a chapa as a response to a fairly open meia lua. The defender performs an esquiva in the same direction as the kick, followed by a chapa (a) with the following leg, keeping weight where it is, or (b) bringing the following leg in and kicking backwards with the standing leg. (NB that (a) is close to but shouldn’t turn into gancho — be more direct!)</p>
<pre><code>Meia lua               / Esquiva
Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...</code></pre>
<p>Defending the chapa is where it gets tricky. Moving from meia lua to leaping back, shifting the weight and the rotation in the opposite direction. The end position is a half-squat with the former kicking foot flat on the ground and the standing leg outstretched on the ground. Making sure you’re not landing hand-first as you’re quickly going to really hurt your wrist.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2013-04-12</h3>
<p>Moving round in a circle — walking forwards, backwards, deep lunging steps, on all fours forwards, backwards, forwards but <em>really</em> low (killer).</p>
<p>Fall back on one leg, the other forward, and au on the side of the forward leg. Try to step from one hand to the other with the au.</p>
<p>Queda de tres with the supported side towards your opponent. Push off with both feet and jump to the front, supported on your planted hand. Repeat but the jump becomes a two-footed kick.</p>
<p>Small au stops midway and expands. Drop straight down so you are facing the opposite way and repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Sequence 1:</p>
<p>Simple sequence moving forward with tesoura and au, moving over the opponent and asking a question — as simple or as difficult as you want to make it.</p>
<pre><code>Tesoura                      / Au, drop into queda de rins
Au, drop into queda de rins  \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Sequence 2:</p>
<p>Another simple sequence. The first rabo de arraia just has to be enough to force the esquiva. With enough skill it can just be a flick of the hips…</p>
<pre><code>Feint rabo de arraia                  / Esquiva
Switch &amp; rabo de arraia opposite side / Esquiva</code></pre>
<p>Variations on <em>Chama eu Angola</em>, citing Pastinha or Besouro instead of Angola.</p>
<p>Chama eu, chama eu<br />Chama eu Angola, chama eu</p>
<h3 id="section-3">2013-04-19</h3>
<p>Gentle ginga to warm up. With foot in rear position lower down into crouch with rear foot on toe and front foot flat. Should be stable and mobile, ready for esquiva, turn sideways, au etc. Stand and repeat on other side: ginga then drop into crouch, rise again. Alternately, rise into a low base without ginga, then into crouch; really hit those thighs hard.</p>
<p>When in crouch, role round the forward leg, keeping quite small and tight rather than stretching the leg out. Repeat in both directions. In role mid-point push backwards with both hands so you pivot over the anchored leg and use the aerial leg to land in the same crouch position facing the opposite way from your start position. (Can be done with two people sliding past each other and repositioning around the perimeter of a small circle.)</p>
<p>Esquiva with one hand down, bring feet together and spread feet again facing the opposite direction. Protect and keep an eye on your partner through your legs, switch to the other side. The forward leg is the straight(er) leg as you drop into a crouch, side on to partner. From there you can role into into tesoura or rabo de arraia.</p>
<p>A new song:</p>
<p><strong>Sobrado de Mamãe</strong></p>
<p>O sobrado de mamãe é debaixo d’água<br />O sobrado de mamãe é debaixo d’água<br />Debaixo d’água por cima da areia</p>
<p><em>Tem ouro, tem prata</em><br /><em>Tem diamante que nos alumeia</em></p>

<p>Notes from a charity roda.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to work on controlling level of engagment (ie 1,2,3) where 1 is only exploratory and not combative. Work on letting people move rather than always blocking. Encourage the flow of conversation rather than obstructing it. Spend more time having fun, collaborating…?</li>
<li>Related to that, work on the interplay between leading and following: learning to notice when I’m following (most of the time) and see if I do something about that.</li>
