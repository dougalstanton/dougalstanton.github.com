<h2>Capoeira Training Diary</h2>
<section>
<p>I’m just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I’m using forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:</p>
<pre><code>Question / Response
Defence  \ Attack</code></pre>
<p>The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.</p>
<h3 id="section">2013-03-21</h3>
<p>Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular</code></pre>
<p>Ginga with “breaks” — <em>giro</em> (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish), <em>pulo</em> (jump, from side to side), <em>chamada</em> (facing off to one side, legs together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).</p>
<p>Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the other side.</p>
<p>Sequence:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia</code></pre>
<p>Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change direction until Left’s foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to turn into a chapa.</p>
<p>Variant 1:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Variant 2:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Right’s QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs to protect before spreading for the tesoura.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">2013-04-04</h3>
<p>Practise ginga: with a firm base and a light expressive top half; and with an agile, light base and a solid top half.</p>
<p>Quite an intricate sequence starting from a chapa as a response to a fairly open meia lua. The defender performs an esquiva in the same direction as the kick, followed by a chapa (a) with the following leg, keeping weight where it is, or (b) bringing the following leg in and kicking backwards with the standing leg. (NB that (a) is close to but shouldn’t turn into gancho — be more direct!)</p>
<pre><code>Meia lua               / Esquiva
Jump back to negativa  \ Chapa (either leg)
S-dobrado              / giro or au or ...</code></pre>
<p>Defending the chapa is where it gets tricky. Moving from meia lua to leaping back, shifting the weight and the rotation in the opposite direction. The end position is a half-squat with the former kicking foot flat on the ground and the standing leg outstretched on the ground. Making sure you’re not landing hand-first as you’re quickly going to really hurt your wrist.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">2013-04-12</h3>
<p>Moving round in a circle — walking forwards, backwards, deep lunging steps, on all fours forwards, backwards, forwards but <em>really</em> low (killer).</p>
<p>Fall back on one leg, the other forward, and au on the side of the forward leg. Try to step from one hand to the other with the au.</p>
<p>Queda de tres with the supported side towards your opponent. Push off with both feet and jump to the front, supported on your planted hand. Repeat but the jump becomes a two-footed kick.</p>
<p>Small au stops midway and expands. Drop straight down so you are facing the opposite way and repeat on the other side.</p>
<p>Sequence 1:</p>
<p>Simple sequence moving forward with tesoura and au, moving over the opponent and asking a question — as simple or as difficult as you want to make it.</p>
<pre><code>Tesoura                      / Au, drop into queda de rins
Au, drop into queda de rins  \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Sequence 2:</p>
<p>Another simple sequence. The first rabo de arraia just has to be enough to force the esquiva. With enough skill it can just be a flick of the hips…</p>
<pre><code>Feint rabo de arraia                  / Esquiva
Switch &amp; rabo de arraia opposite side / Esquiva</code></pre>
<p>Variations on <em>Chama eu Angola</em>, citing Pastinha or Besouro instead of Angola.</p>
<p>Chama eu, chama eu<br />Chama eu Angola, chama eu</p>
<h3 id="section-3">2013-04-19</h3>
<p>Gentle ginga to warm up. With foot in rear position lower down into crouch with rear foot on toe and front foot flat. Should be stable and mobile, ready for esquiva, turn sideways, au etc. Stand and repeat on other side: ginga then drop into crouch, rise again. Alternately, rise into a low base without ginga, then into crouch; really hit those thighs hard.</p>
<p>When in crouch, role round the forward leg, keeping quite small and tight rather than stretching the leg out. Repeat in both directions. In role mid-point push backwards with both hands so you pivot over the anchored leg and use the aerial leg to land in the same crouch position facing the opposite way from your start position. (Can be done with two people sliding past each other and repositioning around the perimeter of a small circle.)</p>
<p>Esquiva with one hand down, bring feet together and spread feet again facing the opposite direction. Protect and keep an eye on your partner through your legs, switch to the other side. The forward leg is the straight(er) leg as you drop into a crouch, side on to partner. From there you can role into into tesoura or rabo de arraia.</p>
<p>A new song:</p>
<p><strong>Sobrado de Mamãe</strong></p>
<p>O sobrado de mamãe é debaixo d’água<br />O sobrado de mamãe é debaixo d’água<br />Debaixo d’água por cima da areia</p>
<p><em>Tem ouro, tem prata</em><br /><em>Tem diamante que nos alumeia</em></p>
<h3 id="charity-roda">2013-04-21 Charity roda</h3>
<ul>
<li>Need to work on controlling level of engagment (ie 1,2,3) where 1 is only exploratory and not combative. Work on letting people move rather than always blocking. Encourage the flow of conversation rather than obstructing it. Spend more time having fun, collaborating…?</li>
<li>Related to that, work on the interplay between leading and following: learning to notice when I’m following (most of the time) and see if I do something about that.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section-4">2013-04-26</h3>
<p>Some work on low ginga, moving slowly and maintaining a constant distance and connection from each other. I really need to work on this sense of flow and constant movement alongside the connectivity: it seems to be one or another at the moment.</p>
<p>Kicking practice — rabo de arraia, rabo de arraia sem mão and armada. Particular emphasis on minimising telegraph with rabo de arraia by not stepping forward but spinning from the base of the ginga. Also armada followed by bananeira on each side.</p>
<p>Sequence (might have been two mixed together, can’t remember)</p>
<pre><code>Negativa left
Swing foot in front and negativa to the right
Bananeira to the right
Land on right foot, step in with left foot
Rabo de arraia with right foot</code></pre>
<h3 id="first-class-in-overnewton">2013-05-02 First class in Overnewton</h3>
<p>Injured left side so just played pandeiro and sang. Things to concentrate on w.r.t. music:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singing at the right time so the boom-ba matches up with the lyrics which typically contain a da-da rhythm themselves. Or remember at which point the singing is supposed to start. :-<br /></li>
<li>Getting the correct pitch for <em>Bahia de todos os santos</em>, particularly for the second line of each verse which goes up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dions-class-in-airdrie">2013-05-09 Dion’s class in Airdrie</h3>
<p>Flexibility work: forward splits, rotation to forward splits facing the other direction. Half ponte and straight-legged stretch (like a half ponte or role but with legs out straight in a wide V, heels on the ground).</p>
<p>Flow work: moving across the ground with role/ginga, stop into bananeira, and back to moving again.</p>
<p>Rabo de arraia then step back into bananeira. Upright alternative: rabo de arraia then bring knee of kicking leg up and through. A knee, or a threatened chapa, or a defence.</p>
<p>Chamada-style head-to-belly stance. Upright person leads and crouched person has to follow while maintaining constant connection.</p>
<p>One person breaks into the other person’s meia lua with a decisive butt to the sternum. Hands up to protect on side of incoming leg.</p>
<pre><code>Meia lua de frente / cabecada</code></pre>
<h3 id="dions-workshop-in-drumnadrochit">2013-05-11 Dion’s workshop in Drumnadrochit</h3>
<p>Lots of mobility work and relaxation emphasis. Ginga, “crocodile” (travelling tesoura move, head and body low to ground), “lizard” (similar but forward, with upward bend every few paces), “elephant” (straight-legged backwards walk with body folded double and short steps).</p>
<p>Tesoura. Tesoura and au with one protecting from cabecada.</p>
<h3 id="revision-of-dions-teachings">2013-05-24 Revision of Dion’s teachings</h3>
<p>Piolho away; Nick taking us through some of the work that Dion was doing with us. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ginga work. Two phases: the first ignores the body and concentrates on the legs, keeping things solid and deliberate.</p>
<p>Exercises included (i) always being open (wide-legged stance, no crossing legs over), (ii) always crossing legs over (much spinning and standing with legs together, (iii) “exploration” of space by maintaining all your weight on the support leg until the last moment and then switching to the other leg.</p>
Second phase was to concentrate on upper half leaving legs alone to do their thing: sway first from the hips, then moving from the waist and chest, then finally bringing the shoulders and head in, to the point of leading with the head (chin first?).</li>
<li><p>Ponte work. Ponte rotation along a wall, choosing a horizontal line to follow and then return other way. Increase difficulty by choosing a lower line on the wall and placing your feet further from the wall. In essence, moving the body towards horizontal.</p>
<p>Attempting similar moves from the ground. Lying back bring feet up underneath and take weight onto head/shoulders to get hands onto the ground and holding some weight.</p>
Otherwise starting from queda de rins take weight on head and try to spin hand on ground to be positioned “backwards”.</li>
<li><p>Progressive cabecada and au, maintaining contact with the head throughout the au. Concentrate on the opponent not the ground during au!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other thoughts for the lesson: think about decisiveness. Choosing whether to go for a move or not, or to fake a move or not.</p>
