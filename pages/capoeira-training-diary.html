<h2>Capoeira Training Diary</h2>
<section>
<p>I’m just making up notation as I go here. For sequences in pairs I’m using forward and back slashes to indicate the question/answer nature of the moves:</p>
<pre><code>Question / Response
Defence  \ Attack</code></pre>
<p>The intuition is that the attacker is leaning over the defender, imposing a situation on them which they have to respond to. Make sense? :-) The two players are named Left and Right regardless of role in that instant.</p>
<h3 id="section">2013-03-21</h3>
<p>Add variants to standard Angola/Sao Bento Pequeno, where the regular and variant are played in a two bar loop. The variants for each rhythm are played during the regular phase for the other rhythm.</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 | O=open, C=closed, #=caxixi
O C   # O # C   | Angola: regular then variant
C O OO  C O   # | SBP:    variant then regular</code></pre>
<p>Ginga with “breaks” — <em>giro</em> (spin round one leg, leaning back at finish), <em>pulo</em> (jump, from side to side), <em>chamada</em> (facing off to one side, legs together and arms outstretched, appearing unbalanced).</p>
<p>Bananeira to one side, then the other. Bananeira stepping away first, then entering before the same on the other side. Step away into bananeira, then drop quickly into negativa; then cocorinha and back in to start again on the other side.</p>
<p>Sequence:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg and esquiva
Duck low under leg            \ Role over leg then rabo de arraia</code></pre>
<p>Left should try to avoid coming up before ducking down again, instead staying down the whole time. Right should be careful not to change direction until Left’s foot has passed, as it is easy for the RdA to turn into a chapa.</p>
<p>Variant 1:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Enter leg, negativa
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Variant 2:</p>
<pre><code>Rabo de arraia to force move  / Esquiva
Rabo de arraia opp. direction / Queda de rins, parry kick with leg
Over or under as required     \ Tesoura</code></pre>
<p>Right’s QDR should be strong and might benefit from contracting the legs to protect before spreading for the tesoura.</p>
