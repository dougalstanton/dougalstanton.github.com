<h2>BJJ Training Diary</h2>
<section>
<p>A collection of notes and thoughts from learning jiujitsu at <a href="http://www.crosscombat.co.uk" title="Cross Combat home page">Cross Combat</a> in Tollcross.</p>
<h3 id="section">2014-12-30</h3>
<p>Second last day of the year and I finally get around to writing down stuff we’ve been training. I’ve got a sore windpipe at the moment from a slapdash choke attempt — tilting my head to the left hurts the right-hand side of my windpipe. I guess it’s a pretty delicate piece of machinery.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I was injured but attended a class to listen and watch from the sidelines. The class was mostly about movement, particularly creating space to move into. Today’s class was similar but with less focus on creating space, more on using the space that exists.</p>
<p>It’s hard to keep remembering, that’s certainly true. In the moment when someone’s grabbing your arm and you’ve a reasonable idea what they want to do with your arm — then it’s hard not to just <strong>push</strong> as hard as you can to oppose them. But I’ll say this, on the brief occasions where the initial instinct was stopped (because position/angle/weight meant that I couldn’t just push back) and I took a moment to think, and then remembered the advice, at that point it generally worked. Which is both gratifying (because nothing else seems to work) and infuriating (because it’s so hard to remember even though it’s simple and effective).</p>
<p>The flipside of the lesson was taking and maintaining control on top. Being close and heavy enough when you want to put pressure on the other person but also being light enough that you can maintain control of your own body as the other person shifts and rolls underneath. Letting them make a move and stay above them. Closing distance and being in contact was really hard. Being light and moving around the person maintain height on them was easier. I felt generally quite agile today when it came to moving and shifting to follow, though as I say not quick enough to always be in close contact when the moment demanded it.</p>
