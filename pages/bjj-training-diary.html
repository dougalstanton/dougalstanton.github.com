<h2>BJJ Training Diary</h2>
<section>
<p>A collection of notes and thoughts from learning jiujitsu at <a href="http://www.crosscombat.co.uk" title="Cross Combat home page">Cross Combat</a> in Tollcross. I’m not going to concentrate too heavily on techniques because there’s no way I could hope describe even what I can remember. Just look at YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="using-space">2014-12-30: Using space</h3>
<p>Second last day of the year and I finally get around to writing down stuff we’ve been training. I’ve got a sore windpipe at the moment from a slapdash choke attempt — tilting my head to the left hurts the right-hand side of my windpipe. I guess it’s a pretty delicate piece of machinery.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago I was injured but attended a class to listen and watch from the sidelines. The class was mostly about movement, particularly creating space to move into. Today’s class was similar but with less focus on creating space, more on using the space that exists.</p>
<p>It’s hard to keep remembering, that’s certainly true. In the moment when someone’s grabbing your arm and you’ve a reasonable idea what they want to do with your arm — then it’s hard not to just <strong>push</strong> as hard as you can to oppose them. But I’ll say this, on the brief occasions where the initial instinct was stopped (because position/angle/weight meant that I couldn’t just push back) and I took a moment to think, and then remembered the advice, at that point it generally worked. Which is both gratifying (because nothing else seems to work) and infuriating (because it’s so hard to remember even though it’s simple and effective).</p>
<p>The flipside of the lesson was taking and maintaining control on top. Being close and heavy enough when you want to put pressure on the other person but also being light enough that you can maintain control of your own body as the other person shifts and rolls underneath. Letting them make a move and stay above them. Closing distance and being in contact was really hard. Being light and moving around the person maintain height on them was easier. I felt generally quite agile today when it came to moving and shifting to follow, though as I say not quick enough to always be in close contact when the moment demanded it.</p>
<h3 id="top-mount">2015-01-05: Top mount</h3>
<p>First class of the new year; and absolutely jammed with people both old and new. The number of new people that come in the door once and never come back is amazing. It happened at capoeira too but it happened less often that it wasn’t so obvious. But with at least one beginner every single session at BJJ it’s relentless and slightly fascinating. What are people’s thoughts when they arrive? Do they really enjoy it — have they in fact decided they’ll not return by the time their first class finishes?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if the second session is harder to attend than the first. Even if the first one went really well there’s that niggling thought that a sample of one isn’t representative. Maybe the next one will be too hard? Maybe everyone was going easy on you because it was your first lesson? Now you’ve got precedent and have to live up to your first impressions.</p>
<p>Anyway, this class we did <strong>mount and mount escapes</strong>. Which I guess you could say is the logical extension from the previous class:</p>
<ul>
<li>from moving into partner’s space, to pushing to create space</li>
<li>from staying on top, to pressing down and restricting partner’s movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously this is only apparent with hindsight.</p>
<p>I felt my lightness was a handicap today. Last week I felt agile and capable of rebalancing when necessary. But when trying to maintain pressure on top I just lost all of that agility and was very often pitched sideways into the mat. I guess there’s some halfway house, quickly transitioning between ‘light’ and ‘heavy’ as the moment requires it. Or to put it another way, learn to control in a more dynamic fashion — I felt quite static on top — “hold on for dear life”, riding a bucking bronco. That was clearly not what the previous lesson was trying to impart.</p>
<p>The mount escapes to half guard seemed more positive. I felt genuine progress there from a position where I had previously felt quite lost/incapable.</p>
<p>The sparring also went quite well, only being tapped out twice I think. I was managing lots of escapes that I hadn’t previously managed, especially from rear chokes and armlocks. My major failing at the moment is total inability to progress when I get to guard, which is quite exhausting on its own. I know we’ve done armbars and omoplatas from there but I have no idea how.</p>
<h3 id="butterfly-sweep">2015-01-08: Butterfly sweep</h3>
<p>Today’s general focus was <strong>butterfly sweep</strong> which was at least as difficult as it looks. I could sometimes manage it while drilling but if the person was really trying to resist then I didn’t have a chance. This was quite apparent in sparring at the end — while we always started in “position of the week”* I was quickly broken and any attempt at performing the sweep was a total washout (hurray).</p>
<p>*Not too dissimilar to More! Magazine’s features, on reflection.</p>
<p>Otherwise I really think I need to spend more time breaking the habits of the less five years and being close. All my instinct from capoeira is telling me to be placed and stable on arms and legs but really I know I’m supposed to weigh down on my opponent if possible, surfing them to maintain balance. My inability to do this is the same problem I had doing “contact improvisation” — always wanting to be standing on hands or feet or both. I think this ultimately makes me more prone to being thrown aside.</p>
<p>And while it’s not really in the spirit of things, I want to take a small moment to commemorate my first submission. I’ve had several classes where I’m beginning to defend manoeuvres which once would have finished me. It’s great to last several minutes instead of several seconds. But this shows that I can also, under limited circumstances, go on the offensive. I’m not pretending it was an elegant or technically brilliant submission but the fact of its existence is a small victory.</p>
<h3 id="upness">2015-01-12: Upness</h3>
<p>Did this class with a cycling-related injury in my left wrist so I wasn’t really on top form. The focus was <strong>upness</strong>, being above (if not on top) of your opponent. The intention was maintaining that constant-pressure-with-flexibility that we effectively cover in every class. There was no obvious technique as part of the drill — just moving from half-guard to being on top.</p>
<p>My biggest trouble while doing these exercises is that I start in position A and then hold on for dear life until I’m eventually swept. But the spirit of the exercise seems to be starting from A, transitioning through B, C, F, back to C then D and so on as the other person demands it. Learning to <em>flow</em> with their pushes and pulls but recover and re-assert dominance, rather than <em>fall</em> to the inevitable better opponent.</p>
<p>All that aside my wrist couldn’t really take any weight so I was doing a lot of pushing with my left elbow/forearm instead. At the end of the class I managed what felt like quite an effective escape from half guard but then my training partner dropped on my ankle at a funny angle and I had to call it a night. There was no way I was really up for the full sparring anyway. Limping home was hard enough at that point.</p>
<h3 id="open-guard-pass">2015-01-22: Open Guard Pass</h3>
<p>The usual story about upness through the medium of <strong>passing the open guard</strong> and closing distance on the opponent to gain some kind of side control or mount.</p>
<p>Not much technical again, just experimentation. Things to note was my habit (when defending) of being quite passive and waiting to see what the other person did. Being more active seems sensible: trying to predict their movements and trying to imbalance them so they have no stable starting point from which to move.</p>
<p>Being more aggressive while sparring seemed to help too though it just led to lots of stalling. Once the other person has turtled I need to really think “get onto them, turn around so I’ve got their head” to get out of this stalling.</p>
<p>When I’m trapped in mount I always forget to bridge which is really silly but there you go.</p>
<h3 id="scissor-sweep">2015-02-02: Scissor sweep (?)</h3>
<p>I sat this one out which is a shame because it looked pretty interesting. It was covering a sweep from guard that I <em>think</em> is called <strong>scissor sweep</strong> though it wasn’t explicitly mentioned. It matches fairly closely the descriptions found elsewhere and there was a bit of emphasis on “scissor action” with the legs at one point. I’ve definitely covered this once before in class but I’d like a chance to cover it again.</p>
<p>Details that seemed important from observation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding the person’s upper body close puts them off balance. If they’ve managed to get upright they have much better self-control. Hold onto the arm on their falling side to keep them close and prevent them posting.</li>
<li>To lift the raised leg up point your own knee up!</li>
<li>If the sideways sweep is too hard then pushing it away is easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="high-mount">2015-02-19: High mount</h3>
<p>Maintaining control with lots of pressure right up at the person’s head, or conversely trying to push the other person off from the <strong>high mount</strong> position. It’s easier to gain leverage from the bottom with elbows low at your sides, and harder with arms high and elbows pointing up. Which is interesting because instinctively you’d be inclined to keep your arms high over your head/face for protection.</p>
<p>From mount maintaining pressure is really important but I couldn’t achieve control from that position without sacrificing freedom to attempt submissions. I was clamped-on in high mount and not letting go — but not achieving much either. Eventually the timer would end or I would get tossed aside.</p>
<h3 id="triangle">2015-02-26: Triangle</h3>
<p>Mostly covering <strong>triangle escape</strong>, or triangle survival maybe. Either way I don’t think I really managed it in earnest.</p>
<p>Tried a scissor sweep in sparring, totally failed. Why? I realise in hindsight I didn’t have control of the person’s upper body. They were stable and upright but I should have had them stretched out and unbalanced. But it is interesting to spot my mistake. My total inability to do anything other than hold on for dear life once someone’s in my closed guard is a real problem. It becomes a danger to me; when I eventually end up there I have no escape. In fact I’m almost more confident escaping from bottom of mount. At least I have approaches to take.</p>
<h3 id="armbar">2015-03-02: Armbar</h3>
<p>Work getting comfortable in armbar from guard, and 3D rotations from the same configuration. The position holding the armbar while you’re “stacked” on your own head is not at all comfortable. And the escape we practised was to stack the person, stop them rotating around/away and lifting their head/neck off the mat.</p>
<p>The tricky point was managing any of the manoeuvre while keeping hold of the arm. Really holding the body down (eg by the calf on the neck) helps but getting fluidly into position without losing that grip is still really hard.</p>
<h3 id="armbar-triangle-omoplata">2015-03-5: Armbar, Triangle, Omoplata</h3>
<p>Really good class today, focussing on slipping from one submission to another as the situation demands it, and spotting the situations as they appear too. The hardest out of all three is still definitely the <strong>arm bar</strong>: the spin on the back is still so difficult.</p>
